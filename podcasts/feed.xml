            <itunes:author>Christopher Hanusa</itunes:author>
            <itunes:subtitle>Ray Chin answers a counting question related to card collecting.</itunes:subtitle>
            <description>Ray Chin discusses his childhood hobby involving card collecting. (Cards such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic the Gathering, Baseball cards, etc.) He asks the question "In how many ways can you collect a full set of 10 cards when every deck you buy contains five random cards each?".  This research was conducted during Fall 2014 in Professor Hanusa's Combinatorics class at Queens College of the City University of New York.</description>
