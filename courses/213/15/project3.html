                    <p>The final product of this project will be a Mathematica notebook that:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Is interactive and uses advanced capabilities of Mathematica</b>
                            <p>Your program must have some sort of user interactivity.  For example, this may be by way of a Manipulate command, user input (keyboard / mouse / game controller), or file importing (such as text / spreadsheet / image). You are expected to use multiple new commands that we have not learned so far this semester.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Motivates you</b>
                            <p>You have free range in the topic you choose.  Once you have chosen the project focus, I will help you refine the scope so that your project is neither too complex nor too simple.  I want you to choose a topic that will keep your interest for the remainder of the semester.  It is your choice whether to create something useful or something fun. (Or both!)  When you are choosing a topic, bring in your personal interests.  Are you interested in higher mathematics? finance? music? art? geography? other sciences? games? something else? </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Is commented and explained so that others can understand your work.</b>  
                            <p>Your Mathematica notebook will be filled with complex code; you must make sure that the code you create is readable by others.  Throughout the code insert comments (* like this *) to explain what you are doing to people familiar with programming in Mathematica.  Use text cells that explain to unsophisticated end users the premise of your project and how to interact with your notebook.  If the interactivity in your project is in the form of a Manipulate command, your project may be uploadable to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>

                        <li><strong>Project Proposal due Monday, April 20:</strong> <p>Before class on Monday, April 20, determine the capabilities of Mathematica that you would like to explore.  Places to find inspiration include the Wolfram Demonstrations Project, Mathematica Documentation, and the last chapters of our textbook.  Once you settle on a subject area, start to conceptualize what type of project you would like to create.  Who will be the audience for your Mathematica notebook?  What type of interactivity do you want your user to have?</p>
                            <p>Write up your ideas and bring them to class on Monday, April 20.  We will meet to discuss your proposal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Outline due Monday, April 27:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date you should have settled on a framework for your project, and started considering strategies that will help you program Mathematica to do what you want.  Make sure you have spent some time researching some concepts that you will need for your project.  Prepare a short outline (at most 1/2 page; bullet points are fine) that highlights how you think you will proceed.  Start a Mathematica notebook in which you play around with some of these concepts. Bring it to class and continue working on your project; today will be an in-class project work day.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Project Check-Up on Monday, May 4:</strong> 
                            <p>Bring in the current state of your project and Prof. Chris will walk around and consult with you on any questions you might have.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Project Draft on Monday, May 11:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed most of your project.  The class period this day will be devoted to working on your project; Prof. Chris will walk around and consult with you on any last-minute questions you might have.  If you want to upload your project to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project, I will help you format it to prepare it to be submitted.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Project Presentation on Wednesday, May 13 or Monday, May 18:</strong> <p>On this day, you will present your project to the rest of the class, explaining what your project does, highlighting the interactivity and sharing your favorite parts of your project for the class.</p>
                        </li>

                    <p>This project represents 25% of your semester grade.  You will be graded on how well your project addresses the specifications laid out above, and on your presentation of your notebook.  You are expected to arrive on time and make comments on your classmates' presentations and projects.  If you are late or absent, this will negatively affect your own grade.</p>
