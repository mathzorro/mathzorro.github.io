                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>Create a Mathematica tutorial to help students with coursework from another class.  <br>It is suggested, but not required, that the other class be a Mathematics class. </p>
                    
                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>
                    
                    <p>The final product of this project will be a Mathematica notebook that:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Presents a clear project statement.</b>
                            <p>Assume that your user is in your target audience.  Address precisely the topic that you are highlighting in the tutorial. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Shows the user how to acheive the desired result using Mathematica in a well-documented way.</b>  
                            <p>You should introduce the specialized commands that the user needs to know, explaining what they do, and how they work.  You should write clearly the methods that the students need to follow in order to get the final result.  You should work through a representative example to highlight your methods.  (A <span style="font-family: monospace;">Manipulate</span> command would be great to include here!)  At the end of the worksheet, you should include between one and three more examples that the user should try on their own. All guidance should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs, and included in text cells.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Is formatted in a clear and organized manner.</b> 
                            <p>The project should be a well-organized Mathematica notebook, where the methods are broken down into sections labeled with appropriate and descriptive headings.  Subsections and itemized lists should be used where appropriate.</p> </li>

                        <li><strong>Project Proposal due Monday, February 23:</strong> <p>Before class on Monday, February 23, decide upon the thrust of your project.  Which class will you focus on?  Who will be the audience for your Mathematica notebook?  What topic in that class was difficult to understand and would benefit from a Mathematical tutorial?</p>
                            <p>In class on Monday, February 23, we will meet to discuss your proposal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare Project Ideas for Wednesday, February 25:</strong> 
                            <p>For this day, make sure you have spent some time researching some concepts that you will need for your project.  Start a Mathematica notebook where you play around with some of these concepts.  Bring it to class and I will brainstorm with you about your project.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Draft on Monday, March 2:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed most of your project.  The class period this date will be devoted to working on your project; Prof. Chris will walk around and consult with you on any questions you might have.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Presentation on Wednesday, March 4:</strong> <p>On this day, you will present your project to the rest of the class, explaining what your project does, and working through a representative example for the class.</p>

                    <div class="date">Grading</div>

                    <p>This project represents 15% of your semester grade.  You will be graded on how well your project addresses the specifications laid out above, and on your presentation of your notebook.  You are expected to arrive on time and make comments on your classmates' presentations and projects.  If you are late or absent, this will negatively affect your own grade.</p>

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>Design and print a piece of three-dimensional art using Mathematica.</p>
                    
                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>
                    
                    <p>The final product of this project will be a piece of art that:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Originates from some mathematical idea or concept.</b>
                            <p>Your work should have at its base some mathematical idea that interests you.  You may choose to try to faithfully replicate the concept or simply use the concept as a seed in a more abstract piece.  As part of this project, you will be expected to write, revise, and polish a one-page discussion of the choices you have made in designing the piece of art, from choice of topic to your decisions about the physical manifestation of your piece.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Uses functional techniques from Mathematica.</b>
                            <p>A common theme in many pieces of Mathematical art is the use of repetition or symmetry; Mathematica excels at both.  Your art should be designed to make use of these capabilites.  Of great use will be the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Manipulate</span> command which will allow you to modify certain parameters of your construction in order to find an optimal<sup>*</sup> arrangement.</p>
                            <p><sup>*</sup> So perhaps you want a definition of <i>optimal</i>?  Your creativity comes into play here; it should allow you to bring out the quality you want the most in your project.  Do you want most aestheic? least aesthetic?  Smoothest? Roughest? Most proportional? Least proportional?</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Has been critiqued, refined, and revised multiple times.</b>  
                            <p>We will work to improve your project at many steps.  What works well in Mathematica?  What doesn't?  What works well when doing 3D printing?  What doesn't?  By refining your project through constructive criticism and through prototyping, you will be able to get the most out of your project.</p>

                            <p>Before class, get inspired!  Explore some mathematical flavored blog posts, watch some mathematical videos.  Take time to browse mathematical and non-mathematical art.  Develop a taste for what you like.  What type of mathematics can serve as a base for your art?  What type of artist do you aspire to be? Comment on the discussion board with links to two or three inspiring objects.</p>

                        <li><strong>Prepare Project Ideas for Monday, March 23:</strong> 
                            <p>For this day, your idea should be getting more concrete.  You should have researched the mathematical topic and started sketching on paper some of the concepts you are considering.  Start a Mathematica notebook that plays around with some of these concepts.  Bring your sketches and  notebook to class and we'll meet in groups to brainstorm ways to improve your project. On this day, part of class will be a discussion of the limitations of 3D printing and how to use Mathematica to best represent your concept digitally.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Draft on Monday, March 30:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed most of your project, including a draft of your one-page writeup.  You will present your Mathematica file to the entire class for  constructive criticism and their feedback.  This will be the time to ask questions you might have to prepare for prototype submission.  
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype submission on Wednesday, April 1:</strong> <p>On this day, we will submit your project to Shapeways for prototyping.  This deadline is important so that you can receive the physical prototype before the end of Spring Break.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype Critiquing on Monday, April 13:</strong> <p>Bring in your prototype to class.  We will all meet and discuss what worked as planned, what didn't work as well as hoped, provide suggestions for polishing and refinement for the final submission.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Final Submission on Friday, April 17:</strong> <p>You should have refined your project and submitted it for printing at Shapeways.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Field Trip on Friday, April 29:</strong> <p>We will meet at Shapeways at 9:00am for a factory tour!</p>
