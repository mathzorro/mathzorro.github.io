<div class="date">Wednesday, September 4</div> 
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have access to a copy of Mathematica <b>outside of class</b>, by either visiting a computer lab on campus or installing it on your own machine by following these steps:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a Wolfram User account</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://user.wolfram.com">http://user.wolfram.com</a> and click "Create Account".</li>
            <li>Fill out the form using a @qc.cuny.edu or @qmail.cuny.edu account and click "Create Wolfram ID".</li>
            <li>Check your email and click the link to validate your Wolfram ID.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Request the download and key.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/b7104dfcd2a4429e4b99f9e29359b03c0f0aea11">Fill out this form</a> to request an Activation Key.</li>
            <li>Click the "Product Summary page" link to access your license.</li>
            <li>Click "Get Downloads" and select "Download" next to your platform.</li>
            <li>Run the installer on your machine, and enter Activation Key at prompt.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Watch at least the first 17 minutes of the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/screencasts/handsonstart/">Hands-on Start to Mathematica</a>.  It is highly suggested that you follow along with Mathematica open alongside to try out the presented commands yourself.  The video will introduce you to how to add sections, text, and mathematical input into your notebooks directly and through "free-form input".  There is also a bit of information about defining variables.

    <br>[<i>It is important to realize that free-form input is nice, but to use Mathematica's full capability, you will need to understand its language; that what this class is about!</i>]
    </li>
    <li>Thoroughly read all pages of the course webpage. This should answer all the questions that you may have about the class.</li>
    <li>Visit <a href="http://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a>.  Take the <b>Syllabus Quiz</b>.  Feel free to refer back to the course webpage to search for more in form.  <b>Retake the quiz as many times as necessary</b> to earn a score of 100%.  This will count toward your participation grade.</li>
    <li>Go to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/qc.cuny.edu/forum/#!forum/213fa19-list">Discussion Board</a> on Google Groups and contribute to the <b>Daily Question: September 4</b>. <b>(Now due September 5.)</b>  <!-- Daily questions were out of order! Make first Daily Q simpler... -->
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/azxwx73hmbcbguaz">Fill out this Doodle</a> to let me know when you are available for office hours this semester.  (Pretend like it is a normal week with no holidays --- select the times when you would be able to come to office hours regularly.)  I will try to choose times that work for most people.</li>

    <li>Spend some time thinking about the topic you would like to work on for <a href="project.html">Project 1</a>.  Write a paragraph that answers the following:
        <blockquote>Which class or general concept will you focus on? Who will be the audience for your Mathematica notebook? Was there a specific topic in that class was difficult to understand and would benefit from a Mathematica tutorial? - OR - Is there a specific topic that you'd like to learn more about in Mathematica?</blockquote>

        <ul>
            <li>First: Upload your final Mathematica notebook to our shared <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ALvrmpSjztAbUk9PVA">Google Team Drive</a>.  Before you do so, give it a better name than "Project 1".    You may be able to drag and drop your file into this window.  Do not close this tab.</li>
            <li>Next: Open a new tab.  Log on to <a href="https://sites.google.com/new">Google Sites</a>.  There should be a link to the site "qcmt"; click on it. </li>
            <li>Now: Figure out where in the website your Tutorial fits best.  If you need to create a new section, create a new section and make the text a "heading".  In a bullet point, write your name, the title of your tutorial, and then a description of your tutorial.</li>
            <li>Last, go back to the Google Team Drive, right click on your file, and select "Get shareable link".  The link has been copied to your clipboard.  Head back to the Google sites page and highlight the name of your tutorial, click on the "link" icon, and paste the link text where it says "Link".</li>
            <li>Click publish at the top, and the latest version will be updated at the website <a href="http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt">http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt</a>.</li>

    Let me know if you have any concerns.</li>
    <li>Sign up for a <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/education-discount">Shapeways for Education</a> account <b>with your Queens College email address</b>. Send Prof. Chris an email with your Shapeways username.</li>
