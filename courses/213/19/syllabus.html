<!-- Remember to flip the classroom, have homework questions quiz the understanding of commands,  ask questions about the at-home tutorial to discuss in class, and have the in-class activities be the challenge questions.  Find a way to incorporate those questions into the grading scheme.

Make sure that it is clear that students are expected to be in class during in-class work days.  Also make sure students understand that not everyone is supposed to create a masterpiece - the final product should be commensurate with abilities.

                    <p><b>Course:</b> Math 213W, Fall 2019. 
                    <br><b>Instructor:</b> Christopher Hanusa &mdash; <b>Email:</b> chanusa@qc.cuny.edu &mdash; <b>Office:</b> Kiely Tower 606        
                        <br><b>Meeting Times:</b> Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:05&ndash;11:55 in KY 061
                        <br><br><b>Course Web Site:</b> http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~chanusa/courses/213/19/
                        <br><b>Course File Repository:</b>  On Google Classroom.  You may first need to log in to your <a href="http://gdrive.qc.cuny.edu/">QC Google Account</a> and access <a href="https://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a> from there.  Our course code is <b>5uptxf</b>.
                        <br><b>Course Discussion Board:</b>  On Google Groups.  You may first need to log in to your <a href="http://gdrive.qc.cuny.edu/">QC Google Account</a> and access <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/qc.cuny.edu/forum/#!forum/213fa19-list">our Google Group</a> from there.
                        <p><b>Textbook:</b> <b>None required.</b>  See suggested resources on <a href="index.html">home page</a>. 
                        <br><b>Software:</b> We will be learning and using Mathematica daily.  <a href="https://myqc.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/mathematics/Pages3/access.aspx">Information about Mathematica Access</a>. 
                        <br><b>Required Expense:</b> Midway through the semester, we will be creating 3D art using Mathematica and sending it to be printed on the 3D printers at <a href="http://www.shapeways.com">Shapeways</a> in Long Island City.  You will have to pay for printing your object.  My best guess is that it will cost in the range of $25&ndash;$50.  (The exact cost will be different for each student and it will depend on the size of your model, and the amount and type of material used when printing.) 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>W Designation:</h2>
                        <p>This course is a Writing Intensive (W) course and fulfills one Writing Intensive requirement. W classes include a significant portion of time devoted to writing instruction. This may include things such as revision workshops, discussions of rhetorical strategies, or reflective writing about writing assignments. You are expected to complete 15 pages of evaluated writing including revisions after instructor feedback.</p>
        
                    <h2>Class Participation:</h2>
                        <p>Succeeding in this class will require your participation.  You will earn a class participation grade based on your attendance and your participation. A great way to participate is to ask questions. A question as simple as "I don't really understand how/why you did X; can you explain it in a different way?" is a great question to ask and it shows that you are involved in the class.</p>

                        <p>You are expected to participate <b>on the course discussion board</b> by asking questions and answering your classmates' questions.  You will participate in the in-class activities including the daily programming challenge, our group discussions, and by discussing the tutorials with your neighbors.</p>
                
                        <p>If you miss a class, <b>you are responsible for the material you missed</b>&mdash;get the notes from your classmates and study group and make sure that you understand the material that you missed.</p>

                    <h2>Daily Programming Challenge:</h2>
                        <p>Through the tutorials, you will learn new Mathematica commands and new Mathematica techniques.  We will work as a class to attack a programming question which uses the skills that we have seen so far.  One student will be chosen to be the lead programmer for the challenge.  They will come to the front of the classroom and (with help from classmates) puzzle through and code a solution to the challenge.  Everyone will have the opportunity to be the lead programmer at least once during the semester.</p>
                    
<!--                    <h2>Quizzes:</h2> 
<p>There will be between three and six quizzes during the semester to gauge your understanding of recent topics. The quizzes will be held promptly at 8:45 and last for approximately twenty to thirty minutes.  There will be <b>no make-up quiz</b> except in the case of a documented emergency. In the event of an unavoidable conflict with a quiz (an athletic meet, wedding, funeral, etc...), you must notify me <b>at least one week</b> before the date of the exam so that we can arrange for you to take the exam <b>BEFORE</b> the actual exam date.</p> -->

                    <h2>Homework Policy:</h2>
                        <p><b>You are expected to be working outside of class.</b>  DO IT!  Because this class is tutorial- and project-based, you are expected to keep up with the pace of the class materials.  You must complete tutorials outside of class if you do not complete them in class.  Follow along on the Course Content page to know what is expected outside of class.  You should be compiling lists of questions to ask your professor and your fellow students as you go along.  Many hours of work will go into understanding small details.  As in any class, you will need to put in the time to fully understand the concepts.</p>
                    
<h2>Study Groups: </h2>
    <p>An important component of your learning in this class is through study groups. Study groups allow you to learn the intricacies of the material; discussion of problems often lead to better understanding and new and more efficient ways to solve the problems.  One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else; misunderstandings that you never knew you had will appear under someone else's questioning!  In addition, seeing that others also struggle with the material helps to put your own level of understanding in a better perspective and will hopefully reduce some of your anxiety.  If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved.</p>


<h2>Grading Scheme: </h2>
    <p>Your grade will be based on class participation, homework, quizzes, and your projects.  Each component of your grade is calculated independently; then all pieces are combined using the following weighted average.
        <blockquote>
            Class Participation: 15%
            <br>Project 1: 25%
            <br>Project 2: 30%
            <br>Project 3: 30%
        </blockquote>
    It is the policy of the Queens College Mathematics Department that if you stop coming to class and do not withdraw from the class before the withdrawal deadline, you will be assigned a grade of WU, which can be worse than a grade of F in multiple ways.  Before it gets to that point, come and discuss your situation with me so that we can come to arrangements and determine the best way forward.
    </p>
                    
            
<h2>Office Hours:</h2>
    <p>I am happy to help you with your homework and other class-related questions during my office hours.  Office hours will be determined by group consensus during the first week of class and will be announced in class and posted on <a href="../../../schedule/19fa.html">my schedule</a>. In addition, you are welcome to make an appointment or stop by my office in Kiely Tower Room 606 at any time. (You can call 718-997-5964 to see if I'm there.) </p>

<h2>Cheating/Plagiarism: </h2>
    <p>DON'T DO IT!   It makes me very mad and very frustrated when students cheat.  Cheating is the quickest way to lose the respect that I have for each student at the beginning of the semester.</p>
    
    <p>Working together with classmates on homework and projects is <u>encouraged</u> and is certainly not considered cheating. On the other hand, <b>copying someone else's work IS cheating.</b>  Please do not consult with students who previously took this class.</p>
            
    <p>It is <u>encouraged</u> to download/explore/use other people's source code to learn about what is and is not possible to do using Mathematica.  However, <b>copying content from online or offline sources and passing it off as your own work IS cheating</b>.  The work you turn in for your projects <b>must be your own</b>, substantially different from work found elsewhere, and include citations of any code that you use or that inspired your project.</p>
            
    <p>I take cheating very seriously. If you cheat, you will receive a zero for the assignment and I will report you to the academic integrity committee in the Office of Student Affairs to be placed on your permanent file.  If you cheat twice, you will receive a zero for the class.</p>

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: </h2>
    <p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should register with and provide documentation to the Office of Special Services, Frese Hall, room 111. The Office of Special Services will provide a letter for you to bring to your instructor indicating the need for accommodation and the nature of it. <b>This should be done during the first week of class.</b>  For more information about services available to Queens College students, contact the Office of Special Services (718-997-5870) or visit their website (<a href="http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/">http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/</a>).
    </p>
        
<h2>Course Evaluations</h2>
    <p>During the final four weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete an evaluation for this course by filling out an online questionnaire. Please remember to participate in these course evaluations. Your comments are highly valued, and these evaluations are an important service to fellow students and to the institution, since your responses will be pooled with those of other students and made available online at <a href="http://ctl.qc.cuny.edu/evaluations/data">http://ctl.qc.cuny.edu/evaluations/data</a>). Please also note that all responses are completely anonymous; no identifying information is retained once the evaluation has been submitted.</p>

<h2>Technical Support</h2>
    <p>The Queens College Helpdesk (<a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/">http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/</a>, (718) 997-4444, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu">helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu</a>) is located in the I-Building, Room 151 and provides technical support for students who need help with Queens College email, CUNY portal, Blackboard, and CUNYfirst.</p>
