<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have access to a copy of Mathematica <b>outside of class</b>, by either <a href="https://myqc.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/mathematics/Pages3/access.aspx">installing it on your own machine</a> or visiting a computer lab on campus.</li>
    <li>Watch at least the first 17 minutes of the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/screencasts/handsonstart/">Hands-on Start to Mathematica</a>.  It is highly suggested that you follow along with Mathematica open alongside to try out the presented commands yourself.  The video will introduce you to how to add sections, text, and mathematical input into your notebooks directly and through "free-form input".  There is also a bit of information about defining variables.

    <br>[<i>It is important to realize that free-form input is nice, but to use Mathematica's full capability, you will need to understand its language; that what this class is about!</i>]
    </li>
    <li>Thoroughly read all pages of the course webpage. This should answer all the questions that you may have about the class.</li>
    <li>Go to our <a href="https://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a> page and complete the following three tasks.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Take the posted Syllabus Quiz.  Feel free to refer back to the course webpage to search for more in form.  Retake the quiz <b>as many times as necessary</b> to earn a score of 100%.</li>
        <li>Complete the <b>First Day Survey</b>. </li>
        <li>Respond to <b>Daily Question: January 31</b>.</li>

    <li>You've worked hard on your Mathematica Tutorials!  Let's share them with the world.  We will work together to create a public facing website using Google Sites.  We will be using our <b>Queens College Google Account</b> (just like with Google Classroom!)
        <ul>
            <li>First: Upload your final Mathematica notebook to our shared <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ABqZepmSRebaUk9PVA">Google Team Drive</a>.  Before you do so, give it a better name than "Project 1".    You may be able to drag and drop your file into this window.  Do not close this tab.</li>
            <li>Next: Open a new tab.  Log on to <a href="https://sites.google.com/new">Google Sites</a>.  There should be a link to the site "qcmt"; click on it. </li>
            <li>Now: Figure out where in the website your Tutorial fits best.  If you need to create a new section, create a new section and make the text a "heading".  In a bullet point, write your name, the title of your tutorial, and then a description of your tutorial.</li>
            <li>Last, go back to the Google Team Drive, right click on your file, and select "Get shareable link".  The link has been copied to your clipboard.  Head back to the Google sites page and highlight the name of your tutorial, click on the "link" icon, and paste the link text where it says "Link".</li>
            <li>Click publish at the top, and the latest version will be updated at the website <a href="http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt">http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    Let me know if you have any concerns.</li>
    <li>Sign up for a <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/education">Shapeways for Education</a> account <b>with your Queens College email address</b>. Send Prof. Chris an email with your Shapeways username.</li>
