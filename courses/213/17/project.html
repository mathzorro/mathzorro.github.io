                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>Your goal is to create a Mathematica tutorial to help students with coursework from another class.  Is there a topic that you learned in a previous class that you really wish you understood better?  What tutorial would you send back in time to "previous you" to help you learn the material better?</p>  <p>It is strongly suggested, but not required, that the other class be a Mathematics class. </p>
                    
                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>
                    
                    <p>The final product of this project will be a Mathematica notebook, a two-page writeup, and a five-minute presentation.</p>  
                    
                    <p><span style="color:#900"><b>The Mathematica notebook must:</b></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Present a clear project statement.</b>
                            <p>Address precisely what topic you are presenting in the tutorial. Make sure it is clear for which class this project was created and assume that your user is in your target audience.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Show the user how to acheive the desired result using Mathematica in a well-documented way.</b>  
                            <p>You should introduce the specialized commands that the user needs to know, explaining what they do, and how they work.  You should write clearly the methods that the students need to follow in order to get the final result.  You should work through a representative example to highlight your methods.  (A <span style="font-family: monospace;">Manipulate</span> command would be great to include here!)  At the end of the worksheet, you should include a few more examples that the user should try on their own. All guidance should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs, and included in text cells.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be formatted in a clear and organized manner.</b> 
                            <p>The project should be a well-organized Mathematica notebook, where the methods are broken down into sections labeled with appropriate and descriptive headings.  Subsections and itemized lists should be used where appropriate.</p> </li>

                            <p>Explain how you chose your topic and why it is reflective of your current level in mathematics. Explain how the quality of your Mathematica file is reflective of  your current knowledge of Mathematica and general programming skills.  Feel free to compare with previous experiences.

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Discuss the revision process.</b>
                            <p>Explain how your project evolved over time, including how discussions with your classmates influenced the ways in which you changed your project.

                        </li>

                        <li><b>Respect the time limit.</b>  
                            <p>Five minutes is a very short amount of time!  This means you really need to have practiced multiple times so that you use your time efficiently.</p>

                    <p>Design and 3D print a piece of three-dimensional art using Mathematica.</p>

                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>
                    
                    <p>The final product of this project will be a physical piece of Mathematical art, a Mathematica notebook, and a three-page writeup.</p>  
                    <p>The piece of art must:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Have a name and description.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Originate from some mathematical idea or concept.</b>
                            <p>Your work should have at its base some mathematical idea that interests you.  You may choose to try to faithfully replicate the concept or simply use the concept as a seed in a more abstract piece.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Use 3D modeling and functional techniques from Mathematica.</b>
                            <p>A common theme in many pieces of Mathematical art is the use of repetition or symmetry; Mathematica excels at both.  Your art should be designed to make use of these capabilites.  You also will be taught multiple methods of creating 3D models using Mathematica.  You will need to apply these advanced techniques to create your model. (You may find it useful to use the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Manipulate</span> command  to modify certain parameters of your construction in order to find an optimal arrangement, where optimality will be based on your personal artistic considerations.)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Takes artistic considerations into account.</b>
                            <p>You are creating a sculpture and you have complete control over the final product.  You get to choose the subject, your interpretation, and the <a href="http://shapeways.com/materials">printing material</a>.  Your creativity comes into play here; it should allow you to bring out the qualities you want the most in your project.  Do you want your object to be smooth? Should it be open so that you can see through it?  Should it be dense?  Should it be visually heavy or light?  What message do you want to convey to observers? Aestheically pleasing? Surprising? Jarring? Proportional? Abstract?  These choices will be documented and included in your writeup.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Reflect your current level in mathematics and computer programming.</b>  
                            <p>You will need to be able to justify why the complexity of your computer code matches your capabilities in computer programming and why the mathematical concepts that form the basis for your sculpture match your mathematical background.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Has been critiqued, refined, and revised multiple times.</b>  
                            <p>We will work to improve your project at many steps.  What works well in Mathematica?  What doesn't?  What works well when doing 3D printing?  What doesn't?  By refining your project through constructive criticism and through prototyping, you will be able to get the most out of your project.  The Shapeways website may reject models that do not match their requirements.</p>

                        <li><strong>Start exploring by Monday, March 12:</strong> 
                            <p>Before class, get inspired!  Explore some mathematical flavored blog posts, watch some mathematical videos.  Take time to browse mathematical and non-mathematical art.  Develop a taste for what you like.  What type of mathematics can serve as a base for your art?  What type of artist do you aspire to be? Comment on Google Classroom with links to two or three inspiring objects.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare Project Ideas for Monday, March 19:</strong> 
                            <p>For this day, your idea should be getting more concrete.  You should have researched the mathematical topic and started sketching on paper some of the concepts you are considering.  Start a Mathematica notebook that plays around with some of these concepts.  Bring your sketches and  notebook to class and we'll meet in groups to brainstorm ways to improve your project. On this day, part of class will be a discussion of the limitations of 3D printing and how to use Mathematica to best represent your concept digitally.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Draft on Monday, March 26:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed your mathematica file.  Today we will upload our drafts to Shapeways to see the problem spots, especially "Strong and Flexible Plastic" and also in the material you hope will be the final material.  This will be the time to ask questions you might have to prepare for prototype submission.  
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype Submission on Wednesday, March 28:</strong> 
                            <p>On this day, we will finalize our projects and submit them for printing at Shapeways in its most forgiving material: "Strong and Flexible Plastic".</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype Critiquing and Peer Review on Monday, April 16:</strong> 
                            <p>On this day, bring your prototype and almost complete draft of your three-page writeup (which may be missing a discussion of the critiquing/revision process).  We will do a peer-review day for constructive criticism.  We will all meet and discuss what worked as planned, what didn't work as well as hoped, provide suggestions for polishing and refinement for the final submission by Wednesday.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Final model submission on Wednesday, April 18:</strong>   
                            <p>You must have refined your project and submitted it to Shapeways for printing in your desired material.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Writeup and Notebook Submission by Friday, April 20:</strong>

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>Create an interactive Mathematica notebook that explores <b>in depth</b> at least one advanced capability of Mathematica.  Think of it as creating your own Demonstration from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps you will create something useful.  Perhaps you will find a new way for users to interact with information? Perhaps you will program a one- or two-player game.  Maybe you create fun ways to interact with dynamic 3D objects that can be printed on a 3D printer?  The possibilites are endless!</p>            

                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>

                    <p>The final product of this project will be an interactive Mathematica notebook, a two-page writeup, and a presentation.</p>  

                    <p>The Mathematica notebook must:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Have a name and description.</b></li>

                            <p>Your program must have some sort of user interactivity.  For example, this may be by way of a Manipulate command, user input (keyboard / mouse / game controller), or file importing (such as text / spreadsheet / image). You are expected to use multiple new commands that we have not learned so far this semester.</p>
                        </li>
<!--                    <li><b>Allow users to interact with your notebook.</b>
                            <p>Your program must have some sort of user interactivity.  For example, this may involve by way of a Manipulate command, user input (keyboard / mouse / touchpad / game controller) by way of an EventHandler command, or file importing (such as text / spreadsheet / image), or some other method of interaction.</p>

                        <li><b>Motivate you</b>
                            <p>You have free range in the topic you choose.  Once you have chosen the project focus, I will help you refine the scope so that your project is neither too complex nor too simple.  I want you to choose a topic that will keep your interest for the remainder of the semester.  It is your choice whether to create something useful or something fun. (Or both!)  When you are choosing a topic, bring in your personal interests.  Are you interested in higher mathematics? finance? music? art? geography? other sciences? games? something else? </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be commented and explained so that others can understand your work.</b>  
                            <p>Your Mathematica notebook will be filled with complex code; you must make sure that the code you create is readable by others.  Throughout the code insert comments (* like this *) to explain what you are doing to people familiar with programming in Mathematica.  Use text cells that explain to unsophisticated end users the premise of your project and how to interact with your notebook.  If the interactivity in your project is in the form of a Manipulate command, your project may be uploadable to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Reflect your current level in computer programming and its subject.</b>  
                            <p>You will need to be able to justify why the complexity of your computer code matches your capabilities in computer programming and why the difficulty of your project matches your expertise in the subject.</p>

                        <li><b>Have been critiqued, refined, and revised multiple times.</b>  
                            <p>We will work to improve your project at many steps.  Work to get feedback from your classmates about your project topic.  We'll do a peer review so that users get the most out of your project.</p>

                        <li><strong>Project Proposal due Monday, April 18:</strong> <p>Before class on Monday, April 18, determine the capabilities of Mathematica that you would like to explore.  Places to find inspiration include the Wolfram Demonstrations Project, Mathematica Documentation, and the last chapters of our textbook.  Once you settle on a subject area, start to conceptualize what type of project you would like to create.  Who will be the audience for your Mathematica notebook?  What type of interactivity do you want your user to have?</p>
                            <p>Write up your ideas and bring them to class on Monday, April 18.  We will meet to discuss your proposal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Outline due Monday, April 30:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date you should have settled on a framework for your project, and started considering strategies that will help you program Mathematica to do what you want.  Make sure you have spent some time researching some concepts that you will need for your project.  Prepare a short outline (at most 1/2 page; bullet points are fine) that highlights how you think you will proceed.  Start a Mathematica notebook in which you play around with some of these concepts. Bring it to class and continue working on your project; today will be an in-class project work day.</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Project Check-Up on Monday, May 7:</strong> 
                            <p>Bring in the current state of your project and we will do an informal peer review in which you get some feedback from a classmate about the concept and about usability.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Project Final Draft on Monday, May 14:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed most of your project and prepared for your presentation.  The class period this day will be a more in-depth peer-review session and then some in-class polishing time.  Prof. Chris will walk around and consult with you on any last-minute questions you might have.  We will work to figure out if it is possible to deploy your worksheets to the cloud or as a Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Project Presentation on Wednesday, May 16 or Wednesday, May 23:</strong> <p>On this day, you will present your project to the rest of the class, explaining what your project does, highlighting the interactivity and sharing your favorite parts of your project for the class.  You are expected to attend all presentations; your presentation grade will be reduced if you are late or do not attend.</p>
