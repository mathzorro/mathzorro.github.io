<div class="date">Tuesday, January 31</div> 
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>If you have a computer at home, make sure you have gotten Mathematica up and running. If not, make sure you have a plan for accessing Mathematica outside of class time. If are running into problems, let Prof. Hanusa know!</li>
    <li>Thoroughly read all pages of the course webpage. This should answer all the questions that you may have about the class.</li>
    <li>Go to our <a href="https://discord.gg/qk6kmnfA3w">Discord Server</a>.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel if you didn't do that earlier.</li>
        <li>Answer the <b>Office Hours Poll</b> posted in the #general channel.</li> 
        <li>Contribute to the <b>Daily Question for January 31</b> <i>thread</i> in the #using-mathematica channel.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <li>Now let's get used to working with Mathematica. The basic building block in the language is a List, and that is the subject of the next tutorial.
    <br><b>Work through Tutorial 2:</b> <a href="mma/250sp23tut02.nb">Introduction to Lists</a>.
    <br>I recorded myself going through Tutorial 2 carefully if you want some additional guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jtgvSl2TdU4">Watch Part 1</a>.  <a href="https://youtu.be/ot6zU3-otsc">Watch Part 2</a>. Download the tutorial file and work through the commands alongside the video, pausing as necessary to make sure you try everything yourself.</li>
    <li>Last, here are two helpful videos developed by Wolfram Engineers to help you get started using Mathematica.
    <ul>
        <li>Here is a quick 5-minute video about <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?c=89&v=1118">how to develop a well-organized notebook interface</a>. The video discusses the different types of cells and how to create them.</li>
        <li>Here is an extremely useful video about <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?c=89&v=1119">different ways to interface with Mathematica</a>. You will learn how to add input using  "free-form input" (time 2:07), the suggestions bar (time 4:12), using Wolfram Language commands (8:50), palettes (time 13:47), and the documentation center (time 16:45).</li>    
    </ul>
    <li>Remember: If you have questions about any of the content in these videos, be sure to ask a question in the relevant channel on our <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord Server</a>.</li>

<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Finalize a framework for your project and decide on the strategies that will help you program Mathematica to do what you want. Determine the mode of input, the type of interface you want to create, and spend some time researching concepts that you will need for your project. Continue to make progress on your project. Your goal is to have it in a roughly usable state by Thursday, May 4th for a very informal peer review about the concept and its usability. </li>
