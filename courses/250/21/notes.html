<!-- Goal: Create screencasts about the tutorials for them to work on outside class.  -->       <!-- Goal: Give them better direction for their projects so that they can work on together.  In Project 2: Are they going to be using ParametricPlot, or Graphics Objects, or PolyhedronData?  In Project 3: Are they going to use ClickPane or EventHandler KeyDown or DynamicModule something else? -->       
                    
<!-- I suggest teaching Switch, revisit If statements in Project 3 tutorials. Also Row, Column, Pane for developing the interfaces. How do we take an input and do something? Have homeworks with the most basic examples of each of these "input + doing something with it" that can be used to build things. And multiple examples of putting "Dynamic" in the right places. -->

<div class="defn"><font color="red">Second class day once your prototype arrives:</font></div>
<ul>
    <li>Think carefully about the peer feedback on your project and the possible changes you identified.</li>
    <li>Spend time exploring alternative versions of your model. Change the size of the model, or of a part of the model. Change something round into something sharp? Modify a parameter? Consider a variation on a theme? This is part of the process and can only make your model better, even if you end up determining that your original decisions work the best. <b>It will be expected that you write about alternative process decisions you could have made in your writeup and that your Mathematica file has an alternate version in it.</b></li>
    <li>Answer the <b>Daily Question: Model Variations</b> on the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/">Campuswire community</a> </li>
    <li>Finalize your model and verify that it is printable through Shapeways in the material you desire. If you are having trouble, sign up for office hours on Tuesday or I can help troubleshoot in class on Wednesday.</li>
    <li>Incorporate the revision and peer review process into your writeup as well as the comments from your peer review partner.</li>
        <li><span style="color:#900;font-weight:900">By the end of the week, turn in your final notebook, writeup, and 3D Printable File.</span></li>

    <li><b>Group A</b> should Revise Project 2 based on the feedback from Monday's class. Answer the <b>Daily Question: Peer Review</b> on the <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/">Campuswire community</a> with the most helpful comment you received during peer review.  If you are having trouble, sign up for office hours on Tuesday or I can help troubleshoot in class on Wednesday.  You should also be cleaning up your Mathematica file and finalizing your writeup of Project 2, which should now include a discussion about the critiquing and revision process.  </li>

Prof. Hanusa will come around and give some feedback about the progress you have made.  You should also be figuring out who you want to work with on your peer review for Project 2 and making a plan for doing so by <b>Sunday</b>.  Monday (and office hours Tuesday) will be for finalizing your model and sending it to Shapeways.</li>

    <li>People whose models arrived before last week should have submitted their Project 2 (above). Spend time over weekend thinking about how you want to approach Project 3. What area of Mathematica do you want to explore more deeply and what type of interactivity do you want to create?</li>
    <li>People who haven't done the peer review yet should have found someone for peer reviewing Project 2, completing the peer review before <b>Tuesday</b>.  (If this is not possible, make sure you have a plan to complete it as soon as your model arrives!)
