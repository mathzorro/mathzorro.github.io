    <li>You've worked hard on your Mathematica Tutorials!  Let's share them with the world.  We will work together to create a public facing website using Google Sites.  We will be using our <b>Queens College Google Account</b> (just like with Google Groups!)
        <ul>
            <li>First: Upload your final Mathematica notebook to our shared <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ALvrmpSjztAbUk9PVA">Google Team Drive</a>.  Before you do so, give it a better name than "Project 1".    You may be able to drag and drop your file into this window.  Do not close this tab.</li>
            <li>Next: Open a new tab.  Log on to <a href="https://sites.google.com/new">Google Sites</a>.  There should be a link to the site "qcmt"; click on it. </li>
            <li>Now: Figure out where in the website your Tutorial fits best.  If you need to create a new section, create a new section and make the text a "heading".  In a bullet point, write your name, the title of your tutorial, and then a description of your tutorial.</li>
            <li>Last, go back to the Google Team Drive, right click on your file, and select "Get shareable link".  The link has been copied to your clipboard.  Head back to the Google sites page and highlight the name of your tutorial, click on the "link" icon, and paste the link text where it says "Link".</li>
            <li>Click publish at the top, and the latest version will be updated at the website <a href="http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt">http://sites.google.com/qc.cuny.edu/qcmt</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    Let me know if you have any concerns.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have caught up with Tutorials 1&ndash;5.</li>

    <li><b>Group A</b> should Revise Project 2 based on the feedback from Monday's class. Answer the <b>Daily Question: Peer Review</b> on the <a href="https://campuswire.com/p/G2E499EB3">Campuswire community</a> with the most helpful comment you received during peer review.  If you are having trouble, sign up for office hours on Tuesday or I can help troubleshoot in class on Wednesday.  You should also be cleaning up your Mathematica file and finalizing your writeup of Project 2, which should now include a discussion about the critiquing and revision process.  </li>
    <li><span style="color:#900;font-weight:900">By the end of the week, turn in your final notebook, writeup, and 3D Printable File.</span></li>
