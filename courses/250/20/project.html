                    <p>Your goal is to create a Mathematica tutorial.  You have two options.
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Create a tutorial to help students with coursework from another math class.  Is there a topic that you learned in a previous class that you really wish you understood better?  What tutorial would you send back in time to "previous you" to help you learn the material better?</li>
                            <li>Create a tutorial to teach someone about the capabilities of Mathematica.  Is there a (broad) topic that you saw as you explored the Documentation Center that you wish you understood better?  What inspires you in real life that you can use Mathematica for? </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    You will be organized into working groups based on the subject you choose so you can get help from each other.
                    </p>

                    <p>The final product of this project will be a Mathematica notebook, a two-page writeup, and a five-minute presentation.</p>  
                    
                    <p><span style="color:#900"><b>The Mathematica notebook must:</b></span>

                        <li><b>Show the user how to acheive the desired result using Mathematica in a well-documented way.</b>  
                            <p>You should introduce the specialized commands that the user needs to know, explaining what they do, and how they work.  You should write clearly the methods that the students need to follow in order to get the final result.  You should work through a representative example to highlight your methods.  At the end of the worksheet, you should include a few more examples that the user should try on their own. All guidance should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs, and included in text cells.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be formatted in a clear and organized manner.</b> 
                            <p>The project should be a well-organized Mathematica notebook, where the methods are broken down into sections labeled with appropriate and descriptive headings.  Subsections and itemized lists should be used where appropriate.</p> </li>
                        <li><b>Assume knowledge from early tutorials.</b>
                            <p>You should expect that your audience has already gained the skills that you have seen in the early tutorials, so you don't have to teach those ideas.  (Feel free to provide a sentence reminder if you feel that would be helpful.)</p></li>

        <p>You will be assigned a score for each standard on an E-M-R-N scale as follows.</p>

                
<p>First I ask myself:</p>

    <center><font size=+2><span style="color: #900">Does this work meet the expectations outlined in the standard?</span></font></center>
    
    <p><span style="color: #900"><b>If it does,</b></span> then depending on how complete and clearly communicated your work is, you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
    
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #900;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Exemplary</td>
    <td>The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete.  Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no non-trivial errors in understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #900;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>M&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Meets Expectations</td>
    <td>Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

    <p><span style="color: #900"><b>If it does not,</b></span> then you have not demonstrated understanding of the concept.  In this case, I will determine if you show partial understanding, and you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
                
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #900;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Revision Needed</td>
    <td>Partial understanding of the material is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #900;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Not Assessable</td>
    <td>Not enough information is present in the work to determine if there is understanding of the concepts.  Work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions.  Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.</td>
</tr>
</table>      
                    
                
    <p>Your final project grade will be based on the number of scores at each level as follows.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Have a name.</b></li>
                            <p>Give your piece of art a name!</p>
                        <li><b>Have a two-sentence description.</b></li>
                            <p>Write a blurb to accompany your piece.  Include some background information (your inspiration / what math you used) and one or two ideas that you were hoping to convey by creating the piece.  Also include the material it is made out of. </p>
                        <li><b>Originate from some mathematical idea or concept.</b>
                            <p>Your work should have at its base some mathematical idea that interests you.  You may choose to try to faithfully replicate the concept or simply use the concept as a seed in a more abstract piece.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Use 3D modeling and functional techniques from Mathematica.</b>
                            <p>A common theme in many pieces of Mathematical art is the use of repetition or symmetry; Mathematica excels at both.  Your art should be designed to make use of these capabilites.  You also will be taught multiple methods of creating 3D models using Mathematica.  You will need to apply these advanced techniques to create your model. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Takes artistic considerations into account.</b>
                            <p>You are creating a piece of art and you have complete control over the final product.  You get to choose the subject, your interpretation, and the <a href="http://shapeways.com/materials">printing material</a>.  Your creativity comes into play here; it should allow you to bring out the qualities you want the most in your project.  Do you want your object to be smooth? Should it be open so that you can see through it?  Should it be dense?  Should it be visually heavy or light?  What message do you want to convey to observers? Aestheically pleasing? Surprising? Jarring? Proportional? Abstract?  These choices will be documented and included in your writeup.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Reflect your current level in mathematics and computer programming.</b>  
                            <p>You will need to be able to justify why the complexity of your computer code matches your capabilities in computer programming and why the mathematical concepts that form the basis for your sculpture match your mathematical background.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Has been critiqued, refined, and revised multiple times.</b>  
                            <p>We will work to improve your project at many steps.  What works well in Mathematica?  What doesn't?  What works well when doing 3D printing?  What doesn't?  By refining your project through constructive criticism and through prototyping, you will be able to get the most out of your project.  The Shapeways website may reject models that do not match their requirements.</p>

                            <p>You should break down your piece of art into its components, explaining carefully your aim and the result of each component. All work should be written in complete sentences and paragraphs, and included in text cells.</p>

                            <p>The project should be a well-organized Mathematica notebook, where the methods are broken down into sections labeled with appropriate and descriptive headings.  Subsections and itemized lists should be used where appropriate.</p> </li>
                        <li><b>Only include relevant Mathematica code.</b>

                        <li><strong>Start exploring by Monday, October 5:</strong> 
                            <p>Before class, get inspired!  Explore some mathematical flavored blog posts, watch some mathematical videos.  Take time to browse mathematical and non-mathematical art.  Develop a taste for what you like.  What type of mathematics can serve as a base for your art?  What type of artist do you aspire to be? Comment on Campuswire with links to two or three inspiring objects.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare Project Ideas for Wednesday, October 14:</strong> 
                            <p>For this day, your idea should be getting more concrete.  You should have researched the mathematical topic and started sketching on paper some of the concepts you are considering.  Start a Mathematica notebook that plays around with some of these concepts.  Bring your sketches and notebook to class and we'll meet in groups to brainstorm ways to improve your project.  On this day, part of class will be a discussion of the limitations of 3D printing and how to use Mathematica to best represent your concept digitally.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Draft on Wednesday, October 21:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be nearing completion of your Mathematica file.  Today we will upload our drafts to Shapeways to see the problem spots, especially "Strong and Flexible Plastic" and also in the material you hope will be the final material.  This will be the time to ask questions you might have to prepare for prototype submission.</p>  
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype Submission on Monday, <s>October 26</s> November 2:</strong> 
                            <p>On this day, we will finalize our projects and submit them for printing at Shapeways in its most forgiving material: "Versatile Plastic".</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Prototype Critiquing and Peer Review on <s>Monday, November 16</s> TBD:</strong> 
                            <p>On this day, bring your prototype and almost complete draft of your writeup (missing the discussion of the critiquing/revision process).  We will do a peer-review day for constructive criticism.  We will all meet and discuss what worked as planned, what didn't work as well as hoped, provide suggestions for polishing and refinement for the final submission.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Final submission on Wednesday, November 28:</strong>   
                            <p>You must have refined your project and submitted it to Shapeways for printing in your desired material. Also on this day, submit a copy of your writeup, Mathematica notebook, and STL file. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Art Exhibition: TBD</strong> <p>We will be having a virtual art exhibit.  You will be asked to give a short artist statement about your project for everyone to learn more about your concept and process.</p>

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>Create an interactive Mathematica notebook that explores <b>in depth</b> at least one advanced capability of Mathematica.  Think of it as creating your own Demonstration from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps you will create something useful.  Perhaps you will find a new way for users to interact with information? Perhaps you will program a one- or two-player game.  Maybe you create fun ways to interact with dynamic 3D objects.  Maybe you will explore how to use user inputs from a game controller or touch screen.  The possibilites are endless!</p>            

                    <div class="date">Specifications</div>

                    <p>The final product of this project will be an interactive Mathematica notebook, a <s>two-page</s> one-page writeup, and a presentation.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Have a name and description.</b></li>

                            <p>Your program must have some sort of user interactivity.  For example, this may be by way of a Manipulate command, user input (keyboard / mouse / game controller), or file importing (such as text / spreadsheet / image). You are expected to use multiple new commands that we have not learned so far this semester.</p>

Once you have chosen the project focus, I will help you refine the scope so that your project is neither too complex nor too simple.  I want you to choose a topic that will keep your interest for the remainder of the semester.  It is your choice whether to create something useful or something fun. (Or both!)  When you are choosing a topic, bring in your personal interests.  Are you interested in higher mathematics? finance? music? art? geography? other sciences? games? something else? </p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Be commented and explained so that others can understand your work.</b>  
                            <p>Your Mathematica notebook will be filled with complex code; you must make sure that the code you create is readable by others.  Throughout the code insert comments (* like this *) to explain what you are doing to people familiar with programming in Mathematica.  Use text cells that explain to unsophisticated end users the premise of your project and how to interact with your notebook.  If the interactivity in your project is in the form of a Manipulate command, your project may be uploadable to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project.</p>

                        <li><b>Reflect your current level in computer programming and its subject.</b>  
                            <p>You will need to be able to justify why the complexity of your computer code matches your capabilities in computer programming and why the difficulty of your project matches your expertise in the subject.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Have been critiqued, refined, and revised multiple times.</b>  
                            <p>We will work to improve your project at many steps.  Work to get feedback from your classmates about your project topic.  We'll do a peer review so that users get the most out of your project.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Only include relevant Mathematica code.</b>

                            <p>Before class determine the capabilities of Mathematica that you would like to explore.  Places to find inspiration include the Wolfram Demonstrations Project, Mathematica Documentation, and the last chapters of our textbook.  Once you settle on a subject area, start to conceptualize what type of project you would like to create.  Who will be the audience for your Mathematica notebook?  What type of interactivity do you want your user to have?</p>
                            <p>Submit your proposal before class.  We will meet in class to discuss your proposal.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Outline due Monday, November 30:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date you should have settled on a framework for your project, and started considering strategies that will help you program Mathematica to do what you want.  Make sure you have spent some time researching some concepts that you will need for your project.  Prepare a short outline (at most 1/2 page; bullet points are fine) that highlights how you think you will proceed.  Start a Mathematica notebook in which you play around with some of these concepts. Bring it to class and continue working on your project; today will be an in-class project work day.</p>

                        <li><strong>Project Final Draft on Wednesday, December 9:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to be have completed most of your project and prepared for your presentation.  The class period this day will be a more in-depth peer-review session and then some in-class polishing time.  Prof. Chris will walk around and consult with you on any last-minute questions you might have.</p>
