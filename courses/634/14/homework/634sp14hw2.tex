Problems {\bf 2D}, {\bf 2P}, and {\bf 2E} should be typed (or written up) and handed in as class starts on Monday 2/3:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\bf 2D.]  

\begin{itemize}
\item isomorphic graphs
\item complement of a graph
\item disjoint union of two graphs
\item subgraph
\item induced subgraph
\end{itemize}

\item[\bf 2E.]  
%11h2, 12h2, 13h1, 14h2
Find two graphs that have at least five vertices and that have {\bf the same} degree sequence, where one of them {\bf is} a tree and where the other {\bf is not} a tree.


\item[\bf 2P.]  
%09h2,11h1,13h2, 14h2
% Pearls 1.1.4.   
Are any of these degree sequences graphic?  
\[\textup{(a) } 5\;5\;4\;4\;3\;2\;2 \textup{ ~~(b) } 6\;6\;4\;4\;4\;2\;2 \textup{ ~~(c) } 6\;6\;6\;6\;6\;6
\textup{ ~~(d) } 6\;6\;6\;6\;6\;6\;6 \]
If you determine that the sequence is graphic, draw a graph with the given degree sequence. If you determine that the sequence is not graphic, prove it.

\end{enumerate}
