%Let $G$ be a connected regular graph with 22 edges.  What are the possible number of vertices that $G$ may have?
{\bf Instructions:}  Draw in lines to connect the circles such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lines must be either perfectly vertical or horizontal.
\item Up to two lines may be drawn connecting the same circles.  
\item The lines may not cross.
\item The degree of each vertex is the enclosed number.  
\item The entire graph must be connected.
\end{itemize}

Consider a tree $T$ that has only vertices of degree $1$, $2$, and $3$.  Suppose that $T$ has exactly 10 vertices of degree $3$.  Find and prove how many leaves $T$ has.   \newline[{\em Important: Prove your answer for {\bf any} tree $T$ satisfying these conditions.}]
