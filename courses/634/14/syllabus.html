                    <h2>Course goals:</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, students should:
                    <ol>
<li>Recall key definitions and be able to give examples showing thorough knowledge of the definitions.</li>
<li>Recall the statements, consequences, and applications of main theorems and graph structure properties.</li>  
<li>Internalize and be able to apply important proof techniques and problem solving skills to unfamiliar problems involving graphs.</li>
<li>Become inquisitive about graphs and be able to formulate one's own interesting questions about graphs.</li>
<li>Recognize the appearance of graphs in real life. Understand that certain real life situations can best be described using graphs.  Understand that graphs have many applications.</li>
<li>Have an appreciation for mathematicians and the mathematical community as people instead of concepts found in books.</li>
<li>See greater mathematics as a group effort instead of as a solitary pursuit. Develop the ability to work productively on mathematics with others.</li>
<li>Develop an appreciation for graph theory as an accessible branch of mathematics that secondary educators can share with their students.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Homework Policy:</h2>
<p>DO IT! There will be two types of homework in this class, due daily.  There will be written homework assignments that you turn in for grading, and discussion homeworks that will be presented at the board.  Each homework will be posted on the course web page the week beforehand.</p>
            


                    <h2>Written Homeworks: </h2>
<p>The written homeworks contribute towards your homework grade.  They will be due almost daily and will consist of two parts, Definitions and Proofs.  Since we will be building Graph Theory from its basics, there will be many definitions for you to learn.  Each homework assignment will consist of a vocabulary list, for which you must write a precise definition, one or two sentences explaining your understanding of the definition (what does it really mean?), and give an example the concept.  Your responses will be given 1, Â½, or 0 points each.</p>
                    
<p>In addition, you will be given one or two homework questions that will require proof and/or exploration.  You are expected to complete homework questions requiring proof <b>only by consulting your classmates, the course materials, or your professor</b>, and <b><i>NOT</i> through internet searches</b> nor by contacting students who previously took this class.  I expect <b>all solutions to be fully justified</b>, unless otherwise noted. Each of the problems will be graded on the following scale.
                            <blockquote>
                                <table>
<tr><td>5</td> <td>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</td>  <td>&#x2713;<b>+</b></td>   <td align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;(110%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>     <td>A well-written homework solution that hits on all the main points.<br>In other words, <b>Perfect!</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td> <td>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</td> <td>&#x2713;</td>           <td align="right"> (90%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	    <td>A well-written homework solution that contains most of the main ideas needed to solve
the problem completely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td> <td>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</td> <td>&#x2713;<b>-</b></td>   <td align="right"> (70%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	    <td>A homework solution that contains some of the main ideas but is not complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td> <td>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</td> <td>&#x2717;</td>           <td align="right"> (50%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> 	<td>A very partial solution or a good start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</td> <td>    0</td>              <td align="right">  (0%)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> 	<td>No work, a weak start, or an unsupported answer</td></tr>
                                </table>
                            </blockquote></p>

<p>I require you to follow some relatively <a href="guidelines.html">strict guidelines</a> for homework submission. It is especially important that your homework be legible and clearly presented, or <b>I may not grade it</b>.</p>
                
<p>It is important to learn how to express yourself in the language of mathematics. In the homework, you should show your work <b>and</b> explain how you did the problem. This is the difference between an <b>Answer</b> and a <b>Solution</b>. It should be obvious to the person reading the homework how you went about doing the problem. This will often involve writing out explanations for your work in words. Imagine that you need an example to help refresh your memory for another class in six months!</p>
            
<p>A guiding principle that I suggest you follow is "Be precise and concise." That is, you should take great care to write your solutions so that you leave no ambiguity to what you mean and that you write no more than is necessary.</p>

                    
                    <h2>Late Written Homework: </h2>
<p>I understand that outside factors may affect your ability to turn in your homework on time. During the semester you will be allowed five total grace days. If a homework is due on Wednesday and you turn it in on Friday, this counts as two of your five grace days. Once you have zero grace days, <b>I will not accept late homework</b>. If you are not planning to be in class, let me know and get it to me <b>beforehand</b>. This is your responsibility. I can accept clearly scanned homework by email, but I will likely expect a physical copy at the next class session.</p>

                    <h2>Discussion Homeworks: </h2>
<p>Once every four or five class sessions, you will have a discussion homework assignment consisting of approximately six homework questions.  Discussion homeworks will not be turned in for grading; however, they should be approached with as much detail as their written counterparts since they will be part of in-class presentations and discussions.</p> 
            
<p>You will be expected to present at least one of these homework questions on the board throughout the semester.  Presentations need not be complete solutions, but you must make some effort to explain what you know.</p>
                            
<p>I will take volunteers for the presentation problems, but if there are no volunteers, I will call on students randomly. If you are not prepared when called upon, you will be expected to present during the following discussion period. If you do not present the second time, it will be counted against you.</p>
                    

                    <h2>Study Groups: </h2>
<p>An important component of your learning in this class is through study groups. Study groups allow you to learn the intricacies of the material; discussion of problems often lead to better understanding and new and more efficient ways to solve the problems.  One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else; misunderstandings that you never knew you had will appear under someone else's questioning!  In addition, seeing that others also struggle with the material helps to put your own level of understanding in a better perspective and will hopefully reduce some of your anxiety.  If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I assume that you will be working in groups when I make up the homework assignments. At the beginning of the semester, the problems will seem easy enough to plug and chug on your own, but as the term progresses the questions become quite complex indeed. When a group works on a problem, everyone can participate.  But when you write up the answers to the problems, <b>write it up in your own way</b>.  <i>I will take off points from all parties if multiple solutions are the same.</i>  <b>Be sure to include an acknowledgment to your groupmates on your homework.</b></p>


                    <h2>Exams:</h2> 
<p>There will two exams during the semester. They will be a class period in length and no calculators, cell phones, or study aides are allowed (or are necessary). There will be no make-up exam except in the case of a documented emergency. In the event of an unavoidable conflict with the midterm (an athletic meet, wedding, funeral, etc...), you must notify me at least one week before the date of the exam so that we can arrange for you to take the exam <b>BEFORE</b> the actual exam date.</p>

                    <h2>Final Project: </h2>
<p>In addition to the homeworks, you will complete a project in the second half of the semester. You will be doing some research about a graph theorist or about a concept from graph theory. More information can be found <a href="project.html">HERE</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Grading Scheme: </h2>
<p>Your grade will be based on written homework, class participation including homework presentations, your course project, and the two exams.  Each component of your grade is calculated independently; then all pieces are combined using the following weighted average.

<blockquote>
Class Participation: 10%
<br>Written Homework: 25%
<br>Exam 1: 20%
<br>Exam 2: 20%
<br>Project and Presentation: 25%
</blockquote></p>
                    
                    <h2>Office Hours:</h2>
<p>I am happy to help you with your homework and other class-related questions during my office hours. I have official office hours as posted on <a href="../../schedule/14sp.html">my schedule</a>. In addition, you are welcome to make an appointment or stop by my office in Kissena 355 at any time. (You can call 718-997-5964 to see if I'm there.) </p>

                    <h2>Cheating/Plagiarism: </h2>
<p>DON'T DO IT!   It makes me very mad and very frustrated when students cheat.  Cheating is the quickest way to lose the respect that I have for each student at the beginning of the semester.  Both receiving and supplying the answers on an exam is cheating.  Copying homework solutions is considered cheating.  Copying text from sources for your project is cheating. I take cheating very seriously. If you cheat, you will receive a zero for the homework/exam and I will report you to the academic integrity committee in the Office of Student Affairs to be placed on your permanent file.  If you cheat twice, you will receive a zero for the class.</p>

<center><b><font color="red">**Please do realize that working together on homework as described above is not cheating.**</font></b></center>
<br>

                    <h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: </h2>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should register with and provide documentation to the Office of Special Services, Frese Hall, room 111. The Office of Special Services will provide a letter for you to bring to your instructor indicating the need for accommodation and the nature of it. <b>This should be done during the first week of class.</b>  For more information about services available to Queens College students, contact the Office of Special Services (718-997-5870) or visit their website (<a href="http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/">http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/</a>).  If you need special accommodation for an exam, you MUST contact me <b>at least one week beforehand</b>.</p>
        
                    <h2>Course Evaluations</h2>
<p>During the final four weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete an evaluation for this course by filling out an online questionnaire. Please remember to participate in these course evaluations. Your comments are highly valued, and these evaluations are an important service to fellow students and to the institution, since your responses will be pooled with those of other students and made available online, in the Queens College Course Information System (<a href="http://courses.qc.cuny.edu">http://courses.qc.cuny.edu</a>). Please also note that all responses are completely anonymous; no identifying information is retained once the evaluation has been submitted.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Support</h2>
<p>The Queens College Helpdesk (<a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/">http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/</a>, (718) 997-4444, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu">helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu</a>) is located in the I-Building, Room 151 and provides technical support for students who need help with Queens College email, CUNY portal, Blackboard, and CUNYfirst.</p>
