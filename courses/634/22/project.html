                    <p>You will be writing a two-page summary of the ideas and giving an 8&ndash;10-minute presentation about what you learn. The presentation will focus more on conveying the information to the audience in a digested way so that learn about your subject, as well as the human aspect of your research into the topic. The presentation will be 8&ndash;10 minutes, which sounds like a lot of time, but it is not. It will take a lot of time to organize your information and practice to convey everything that you want to. The two-page summary will take similar information and put it into a written narrative format, with more of a focus on the mathematics you encountered in doing research into the topic.</p>
                        
                    <p>For the presentation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduce the topic you chose and what inspired you to choose it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Give key definitions that the audience will need to understand your key results. There is no need to repeat definitions that we discussed as a class. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Explain a few key results that you were able to digest from your topic. The number of results will depend on the type of topic you chose. If it is a research paper, there may be only two or three main results. If it is a sub-area of graph theory, there will probably be more.
                        </li>
                        <li>Share some aspect of the topic that you thought was interesting using precise language from graph theory. Help the audience to understand why your topic is interesting.
                        </li>
                        <li>What open directions or questions have you learned are of interest? What is known and what is unknown? If you chose a research paper, what are future directions of work? If you chose a sub-area of graph theory, what do researchers want to learn next? 
                        </li>
                        <li>Share your project experience. What was the biggest hurdle? What was your biggest accomplishment? What did you get out of this opportunity? What does it make you want to learn next?
                        </li>
                        <li>Prepare your presentation using Powerpoint/Keynote/Beamer or a similar digital slide format.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>For the written narrative:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by describing the topic you chose. (But don't discuss why you chose it.) This should be no more than one paragraph.
                        </li>
                        <li>Share key definitions from the paper you read or the sub-area you researched that are necessary to understand the rest of your narrative. These definitions should be written carefully and in paragraph form. Do not repeat definitions that we discussed in class. This should be no more than 1/2 page.
                        </li>
                        <li>Explain the key results that you found in your research and put them into context. Why would someone care about your topic? (For a research paper, this has to do with situating the paper in terms of it being an answer to a research question; for a sub-area, this will relate to applications or other areas of mathematics where this topic arises.) 
                        </li>
                        <li>What open directions or questions have you learned are of interest? What is known and what is unknown? If you chose a research paper, what are future directions of work? If you chose a sub-area of graph theory, what do researchers want to learn next? 
                        </li>
                        <li>Your report should be two full typed pages. If you use LaTeX, use \documentclass[12pt]{article} and text height 9in, textwidth 6.5in. If you use Word, use Times New Roman 11pt font and one-inch margins and 1.5x spacing.</li>

<p>The goal of the course project is to give you a chance to think about how mathematicians (specifically graph theorists) integrate into the mathematical community. </p>
                    <p>You will be doing research into one of the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The life of a graph theorist who interests you.  (This is the suggested project.)</li>
                            <li>A topic from graph theory that interests you and that we have not studied in class.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>You will take the information that you learn and share it in the following two ways.<br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will create and/or edit at least two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Wikipedia</a> pages related to your topic, contributing at least 10000 bytes of information to Wikipedia.  (Approximately 1000 words)</li>
                            <li>You will prepare and present a 8-10 minute presentation about your topic, to be presented on a presentation day at the end of the semester.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
            
                    <h2>Topics:</h2> 
                        <p>Your first task is to find a mathematician (or topic) whose Wikipedia page you will be editing.   A good place to start looking is on Wikipedia's page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_articles/Mathematics#Mathematicians">requested Mathematics articles</a>.  No two people may work on the same page, so I will be keeping a <a href="list.html">list of chosen subjects</a>. If you have any strong preference, you will need to email me early to claim your subject!  Make sure to choose a mathematician or topic whose Wikipedia page is rather sparse, and send me your subject before you do any editing.</p>
                
                        <p style="margin-top:5px;"><b>Acknowledgments:</b> I would like to thank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:1013-josh/archive">1013-josh</a> for his and his students' illuminating contributions about a similar project.  I also thank the <a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program">Wikipedia Education Program</a> for developing teaching resources.</p>
                    <h2>Timeline:</h2>  
                        <p>In order to help your time management, I have broken up the project into pieces. 
                            <em>Disregarding this timeline will negatively impact your project grade.</em></p>
                        <p><span style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><b>Just as with the other homework assignments, if you are running into trouble or you would like my input on your project, I suggest coming to see me earlier rather than later.</b></span></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Project Statement due Wednesday, March 5.</strong> Email Prof. Chris a paragraph explaining: (a) The anticipated subject of your project, and (b) what inspired you to choose this subject. I suggest that you email me your subject as soon as you have decided in order to stake a claim.</li>
                            <li><strong>Outline / initial organization due Wednesday, March 19.</strong> Before class, email Prof. Chris a link to one (or more) sandbox pages in your Wikipedia user space that includes an outline of your project including a plan of attack for your project.   This will include the following:</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The scope of your project---what main points will you be focusing on?  (This requires reading texts and deciding on what is important and what is not.)  Break this down using bullet-points to clarify the major topics.</li>
                                <li>You must also include at least two references that have been published in print form, such as books or journals.  The copy of the source you consult may be on the internet, but they must have appeared in print form at some point.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong><span style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><em>If you are having trouble getting started or would like guidance, meet with me the week before.</em></span></strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Initial draft due (no later than) Wednesday, April 2.</strong> You must have started editing a draft of your Wikipedia page by now.  You can either be working in your sandbox, or having already transitioned out of your sandbox page into a live wikipedia page.  You should move onto a live wikipedia page once you start to feel that your draft has taken shape.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wikipedia page completed by Monday, April 28.</strong>  Send Prof. Chris a link to your completed pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Project presentation prepared for Wednesday, May 14.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Content:</h2>
                        <p>I expect you to make a solid contribution to Wikipedia of at least 10000 bytes of information to Wikipedia, not including Appendices or Bibliography.  (This is approximately 1000 words).  You are expected to link your pages to other current pages in Wikipedia.  You should also provide references for the content you include, perhaps highlighting a few references where interested people might learn more about the topic. </p>
                        <p>For a mathematician, you should create or modify a page with a biography that is at least 750 words, similar in scope to that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_P._Ramsey">Frank Ramsey</a>, and then create or modify a page that explains / describes one of the mathematician's major results using at least 500 words.  The exact breakdown will depend on your mathematician and what makes the most sense in terms of creating useful Encyclopedic content.</p>
                        <p>For a topic in graph theory, you should include some background of where the topic arose and when most research was done on it.  Explain what other topics from graph theory are related and how.  Highlight some key concepts and theorems and explain when they were proved and by whom.</p>
                        <p>In both cases, make sure to state results and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">elaborate</span> upon them; if the math is unclear, I suggest coming to talk with me! Keep in mind why you chose the subject of the project in the first place; this will help guide you in finding material to cover.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:20px">Important: I will be grading your project based on <a href="homework/MathematicianRubric.pdf">this rubric</a>.  Make sure to keep this in mind when working on your project.</p>

    <h2>Grading:</h2>
                        <p>This project represents 25% of your grade this semester (15% for the wikipedia edits and 10% for the presentation).  </p>
