<ul>
    <li>Thoroughly read through the class web page including the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>. This should answer all the questions that you may have about the class. Next, take the <a href="https://forms.gle/PK3r9kQTg4xne4tr7"><b>syllabus quiz</b></a>. Retake the quiz <b>as many times as necessary</b> to earn a score of 100%.</li>
    <li><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/wx3az5czkc67hgvr">Complete this Doodle</a> to let me know when you would be available for office hours during a normal Monday&ndash;Friday week.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are able to log on to <a href="https://webwork.qc.cuny.edu/webwork2/21-2_Math201_01_Hanusa/">Webwork</a>. Create and <b>Download a PDF</b> of your first homework assignment there on Monday's material. <b>Your user name</b> is your CAMS username in <b>all lower case</b>, like alastname100 for Alicia Lastname.  Your password is your CAMS password.  You can check that you have the correct username and password by <a href="https://cams.qc.cuny.edu/">logging into CAMS</a>.  If you try and are unable to login, send me an email to let me know!!!</li>
    <li>Watch the following video lectures on material from Sections 10.2&ndash;10.3. Ask one question on the "Daily Question for February 3" post on our <a href="https://campuswire.com/c">Campuswire Community</a> about something that was confusing or for which you'd like additional information.
