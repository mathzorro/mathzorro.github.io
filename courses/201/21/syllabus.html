                    <p><b>Optional Electronic Resources:</b> <a href="https://webassign.net">WebAssign</a> is not required for this class.  If you ALREADY have access to WebAssign for this book and would like to register for this class to practice homework problems online and use its other digital resources, the Class Key is <b><font color="#950">qc 5882 5364</font></b>. </p>
                        
                    <p><b>Software:</b>
                        We will be using the computational software Mathematica to help us visualize three-dimensional graphs and regions.  The next session details how to gain access to Mathematica.</p>

                        
                    <h3><span style="background: yellow">Mathematica Access:</span></h2>
                    <p>Access to Mathematica is provided for free to all CUNY students which is funded through the technology fee you pay.  To create an account, go to <a href="http://user.wolfram.com">user.wolfram.com</a> and click "Create Account". Fill out the form using your <b>Queens College email account</b>, and click "Create Wolfram ID".  Check your QC email and validate your Wolfram ID.</p>
                        
                    <p>We will be using <a href="https://www.wolframcloud.com/">Mathematica Online</a> to visualize the mathematics and collaborate with each other.  Every time you connect you will need to log in with your Wolfram ID (created above).  The first time you connect you should <a href="https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/7b4007523821203e4174d33350a07e6dfb5f9c81">click here to upgrade your plan</a>. </p>
                            
                    <p>The online platform is sufficient for this class but it is limited in terms of the file size and computational power you are allocated. As with any platform it will not work if you do not have access to the internet.  I recommend that you install Mathematica on your own computer, by following the following steps. First fill out <a href="https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/b7104dfcd2a4429e4b99f9e29359b03c0f0aea11">this form</a> to request an Activation Key. It will be delivered to your QC email. Then click the "Product Summary page" link to access your license. Click "Get Downloads" and select "Download" next to your platform. Run the installer on your machine, and enter the Activation Key from your email at the prompt. </p>
                    
                    <p>By the way: Mathematica is a huge program&mdash;the full installation will take 10GB of space on your hard drive! 
                    </p>

<h1>Class Expectations</h1>
                    
        <h2>Class Structure:</h2>

                    <p>In some ways this is a math class like you’ve come to know, and in other ways this class will feel different because of how it is structured.  As with many classes, there is some amount of mathematical content that you’ll be learning throughout the semester and you’ll need to convey that you’ve mastered.  The material will initially be presented through pre-recorded videos; the time we spend together during class time will be to answer your questions about the material and for us to work through the complicated concepts together or in groups.</p>
                    
        <h2>Class Participation:</h2>
                    
                    <p>Succeeding in this class will require your participation.  You will earn a class participation grade based on how you contribute to the class. Here are some great ways to participate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prepare questions in advance to ask in class based on the video lectures or the homework assignments (Webwork and/or book questions).</li>
                        <li>Ask questions in class when something is unclear.  An effective question to ask when you are lost is "I don't really understand how/why you did X; can you explain it in a different way?".</li>
                        <li>Ask questions in class if you'd like additional explanations about topics.</li>
                        <li>Ask a question in the Campuswire Class Feed.</li>
                        <li>Answer a classmate's question in the Campuswire Class Feed.</li>
                        <li>Contribute to Daily Questions posted on Campuswire.</li>
                        <li>Attend Office Hours with homework questions or to discuss the class material.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Feel free to ask questions by unmuting yourself or by using the chat feature if you prefer.</p>

                
        <h2>Attendance:</h2>
                    
                    <p>I will notice if you stop attending classes and stop participating. This will adversely affect your participation grade.</p>    
                    
                    <p>If you miss a class, <b>you are responsible for the material you missed</b>&mdash;get the notes from your classmates and study group and make sure that you understand the material that you missed.</p>
                
                    <p>Given that we are living through a pandemic and extremely trying times, I fully understand if something comes up and you have to miss a class; you do not need to justify your absence. If you have to miss multiple classes, do send me a heads up and we can come up with some accommodations to get you back on track.</p>
                
                    
<h1>Conveying Your Understanding</h1>

                    <p>In this class there will be three ways to show me that you are understanding and mastering the course content. There will be daily homework assignments, weekly written assessments, and monthly verbal assessments. There will also be an end-of-the-semester reflection that will take the place of the final exam.</p>
                    
        <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
                
                    <p>Daily homework assignments will be posted on <a href="https://webwork.qc.cuny.edu/webwork2/21-2_Math201_01_Hanusa/">Webwork</a>.  I do not assign homework to be busywork; I have chosen questions that help you go over the key concepts from class. You have unlimited tries and you are encouraged to work with your classmates on these problems and ask questions in class.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have also provided a <a href="homework.html">list of questions from our textbook</a>.  They are great ways to practice the concepts.  It may sound counterintuitive, but it's very important to practice more examples of questions that you find difficult, so you strengthen your brain muscles in that area and learn the content more deeply.</p>

        <h2>Written Assessments:</h2>
                    
                    <p>The key mathematical concepts from the class have been distilled into a list of <a href="standards.html">standards</a>. Throughout the semester you will be assessed on your mastery of these concepts by way of three-question assessments.  Your score for each standard will be out of three points as described below.  The distribution of your scores will determine your assessments grade, which will be factored into your final course grade, also described below.</p>
        
                    <p>What is different from the high-stakes "tests" that you might associate with a math class is that there is an opportunity for you to re-assess standards when you want to improve your scores.  This allows you to focus your studying on the concepts that you have not fully understood.  You will be able to reassess <b>up to two standards per week</b>, so be sure to take advantage of this opportunity throughout the semester.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each assessment will be made up of three questions.  Each question will be graded on a 1=Yes / 0=No scale of whether you have conveyed mastery of the material.  The key will be making sure you have written enough to show me that you understand the material, not just give "the right answer".  Then your standard score will be the sum of those grades, which is a score from 0 to 3.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout the semester I anticipate around 25 standards. Your assessment grade will be calculated as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote>                   
                        <table>
                            <tr><td>A&nbsp;&nbsp;</td> <td>(95+)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>           	    
                                <td>Earn a score of 2 or higher on all standards and a score of 3 on twenty of the standards.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>B</td> <td>(85)</td>   	    
                                <td>Earn a score of 2 or higher on all standards and a score of 3 on eight of the standards.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>C</td> <td>(75)</td>   	    
                                <td>Earn a score of 2 or higher on eighteen of the standards and no 0 scores.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>D</td> <td>(65)</td>           
                                <td>Earn a score of 2 or higher on thirteen of the standards and at most two of your scores may be 0.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>F</td> <td>(50&ndash;)&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>               	
                                <td>Earn a 2 or 3 on twelve or fewer of the standards OR earn a 0 on three or more of the standards.</td></tr>
                        </table>   
                    </blockquote>            
                
        <h2>Verbal Assessments:</h2>
                    
                    <p>Once per month you and your groupmates will meet with me to go over the details of your answers to assessment questions.  My goal is to give you an opportunity to convey mathematical ideas verbally and show that you have understood the topics in a deep way.  You will be provided beforehand the topics that will be assessed so that you can study and prepare as a group.  I will provide more details soon about the expectations and grading process.</p>

        <h2>Semester Reflection:</h2>
                    
                    <p>Since the written and verbal assessments convey your cumulative understanding of the material in this class, there is no need for a traditional "final exam".  Instead you will be given a set of questions that ask you to reflect on the learning you have done throughout the semester.  More details will be provided as we get closer to the end of the semester.</p>

<h1>Grading Scheme</h1>
                    
                    <p>Your grade will be based on homework, assessments class participation, and your exams.  Each component of your grade is calculated independently; then all pieces are combined using the following weighted average.</p>
                    
                    <center>
                        Written Assessments: 60%
                        <br>Verbal Assessments: 15%
                        <br>WebWork Assignments: 10%
                        <br>Semester Reflection: 10%
                        <br>Class Participation: 5%
                    </center>
                
<h1>Getting Help</h1>

        <h2>Study Groups:</h2>
                    
                    <p>An important component of your learning in this class is through study groups. Study groups allow you to learn the intricacies of the material; discussion of problems often lead to better understanding and new and more efficient ways to solve the problems.  One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else; misunderstandings that you never knew you had will appear under someone else's questioning!  In addition, seeing that others also struggle with the material helps to put your own level of understanding in a better perspective and will hopefully reduce some of your anxiety.  If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved.</p>
                
        <h2>Our Campuswire Community</h2>
                    
                    <p>We’ll be using <a href="http://campuswire.com/c/">Campuswire</a> for all our class communications. Use Campuswire to ask questions about concepts and assignments and send messages to members of our class community, including fellow students, your instructor, and your TA.</p>
                    <p>The part of the site that shows up first is the “Class Feed” where you can post questions to the entire class (including to me).  These might be homework questions or syntax questions or questions that percolate up from chatroom discussions.  I expect that everyone will participate by asking and answering questions here.  The class feed is also where timely announcements are posted.</p>
                    <p>You can use the “Chatroom” feature to create topic-specific chatrooms for group messaging and collaboration, which will be helpful to communicate about studying and for student-centered discussions.</p>
                    <p>There is a DM section where you can send me a direct message if you have a private question or concern that needs to be raised.  Feel free to use that instead of sending messages by email.</p>
                
        <h2>Teaching Assistant:</h2>
               
                    <p>Christopher Soto is our teaching assistant.  He will answer questions on Campuswire and hold office hours on Friday mornings.  He is knowledgeable about the course content and about Mathematica.  Ask away!</p>

                    <p>The Math Department sponsors the <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/qc.cuny.edu/qc-math-lab-online-tutoring/">Queens College Math Lab</a>, which offers drop-in help for your homework.</p>
                
        <h2>Office Hours:</h2>
                    
                    <p>Office hours is the time that instructors set aside outside of class time for students to come and ask questions.  I am happy to help you with your homework and other class-related questions or concerns. During the first week of class I will send out a survey to determine the best times for office hours and they will be posted by the end of the the first week of class.
                    <!--In this online format, office hours will be made by <a href="https://calendly.com/chanusa/office-hours">scheduling a meeting through Calendly</a>, on Tuesday afternoons and Friday mornings.  The exact hours are also posted on <a href="../../../schedule/21sp.html">my schedule</a>.--> 
                    If those times don't work for you, send me an email or DM and we'll set up a time that works for you.</p>

<h1>Course Policies</h1>
                    
        <h2>Cheating/Plagiarism: </h2>
                    
                    <p>DON'T DO IT!   It makes me very mad and very frustrated when students cheat.  Cheating is the quickest way to lose the respect that I have for each student at the beginning of the semester.</p>
    
                    <p>Working together with classmates on homework and <b>studying</b> for assessments is <u>encouraged</u> and is certainly NOT cheating. (Please <b>DO</b> ask and answer each other's questions on Campuswire!)</p> 
            
                    <p>On the other hand, do not help each other to answer the assessment questions.  Both receiving and supplying the answers on an assessment is cheating.  The work you turn in for your assessments <font color="#C33"><b>must be your own</b></font>.  For the record, <b>copying content from online or offline sources and passing it off as your own work WILL ALWAYS be considered cheating</b> in this and all other classes.</p>
                      
                    <p>Since this is time for joint exploration and learning, please do not ask students who previously took this class for help. The struggle in the class is part of the learning process.</p>
            
                    <p>I take cheating very seriously. If you cheat, you will receive a zero for the assignment and I will report you to the academic integrity committee in the Office of Student Affairs to be placed on your permanent file.  If you cheat twice, you will receive a zero for the class.</p>
                
                    <p>Academic Dishonesty is prohibited in The City University of New York and is punishable by penalties, including failing grades, suspension, and expulsion as provided at <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-procedures/academic-integrity-policy/">this link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: </h2>
                    
                    <p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should register with and provide documentation to the <a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/StudentLife/services/specialserv/Pages/default.aspx">Office of Special Services</a>, Frese Hall, room 111 or by emailing <a href="mailto:QC.SPSV@qc.cuny.edu">QC.SPSV@qc.cuny.edu</a>. The Office of Special Services will provide a letter for you to share with your instructor indicating the need for accommodation and the nature of it. <b>This should be done during the first or second week of class.</b>  For more information about services available to Queens College students, contact the Office of Special Services (718-997-5870) or visit <a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/StudentLife/services/specialserv/Pages/default.aspx">their website</a>.</p>

        <h2>Recording of Synchronous Sections</h2>
                    
                    <p>I will be recording parts of our class for you and your classmates to refer back to later.  Students who participate in this class with their camera on or use a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who are unable to attend live.  If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded.  If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.</p>            
                
        <h2>Course Evaluations</h2>
                    
                    <p>During the final four weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete an evaluation for this course by filling out an online questionnaire. Please remember to participate in these course evaluations. Your comments are highly valued, and these evaluations are an important service to fellow students and to the institution, since your responses will be pooled with those of other students and made available online at <a href="http://ctl.qc.cuny.edu/evaluations/data">http://ctl.qc.cuny.edu/evaluations/data</a>). Please also note that all responses are completely anonymous; no identifying information is retained once the evaluation has been submitted.</p>

        <h2>Technical Support</h2>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/Computing/helpdesk/Pages/Welcome.aspx">The Queens College Helpdesk</a> provides technical support for students who need help with Queens College email, CUNY portal, Blackboard, and CUNYfirst.  You can also contact the helpdesk throug (718) 997-4444, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu">helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu</a>), or in person in Room 151 of the I-Building.</p>
