                    <p><b>Course:</b> Math 201 (Section 01), Fall 2015. 
                    <br><b>Instructor:</b> Christopher Hanusa &mdash; <b>Email:</b> chanusa@qc.cuny.edu &mdash; <b>Office:</b> Kiely Tower, Room 606        
                        <br><b>Meeting Times:</b> Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:10&ndash;2:00 in KY 258
                        <br><b>Course Web Site:</b> http://qc.edu/~chanusa/courses/201/15/
<!--                        <br><b>Link to Blackboard:</b> <a href="https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/login/NoPortal">Blackboard</a>-->
                        <p><b>Textbook:</b> Essential Calculus, Second Edition, by James Stewart (Note: Do NOT purchase the "single variable" version.) I expect most people will have the Second Edition, but if you have the First Edition, that is OK!
                        <br><b>Electronic Resources:</b> If you have purchased a new version of the book, you will receive a printed Access Card with a code that enables you have access to an electronic version of the textbook.  Do not throw this card away. The Class Key is <b><font color="#950">qc 7213 8236</font></b>.

<p><b>Required Homework Software:</b> <a href="http://192.195.176.176/webwork2/QC201/">Webwork</a>.  Login with username Your Last Name (like Hanusa) and password CUNYFirst ID Number (like 11235813).
                        <br><b>This class covers:</b> Sections 9.1-9.4, 10.1-10.9, 11.1-11.8, and 12.1-12.7.  [See <a href="notes.html">course notes</a> for more specifics.]
                    </p>

                    <h2>Course goals:</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, students should:
                    <ol>
<li>Recall key techniques from multivariable calculus and be able to apply them to unfamiliar examples.</li>
<li>Recall the statements, consequences, and applications of main theorems.</li>  
<li>Develop familiarity with functions, surfaces, and operations involving three dimensions, and be able to generalize these ideas to more dimensions.</li>
<li>Develop the ability to work productively on mathematics with others.</li>
<!--
<li>Become aware of the structure of mathematics </li>
-->
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Homework Policy:</h2>
<p>DO IT! You must PRACTICE in order to learn calculus. There will be two types of homework in this class: daily homework assignments discussed in class and online homework assignments, due weekly. Homework assignments will be posted on the course website the week beforehand.</p>


                    <h2>Study Groups: </h2>
<p>An important component of your learning in this class is through study groups. Study groups allow you to learn the intricacies of the material; discussion of problems often lead to better understanding and new and more efficient ways to solve the problems.  One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else; misunderstandings that you never knew you had will appear under someone else's questioning!  In addition, seeing that others also struggle with the material helps to put your own level of understanding in a better perspective and will hopefully reduce some of your anxiety.  If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I assume that you will be working in groups when I make up the homework assignments. At the beginning the problems might seem easy enough to plug and chug on your own, but as the quarter progresses the questions become quite complex indeed. When a group works on a problem, everyone can participate. <b>However, I suggest that you take time to write up solutions to the problems on your own.</b></p>

                <h2>Class Participation:</h2>
                    <p>Succeeding in this class will require your participation.  You will earn a class participation grade based on your attendance and your participation. A great way to participate is to ask questions. A question as simple as "I don't really understand how/why you did X; can you explain it in a different way?" is a great question to ask and it shows that you are involved in the class.</p>

                    <p>One way to participate and earn bonus points is to contribute to the <a href="forum.html">course forum</a>. There is more information about contributing on the forum's top post.</p>

                    <p>If you miss a class, <b>you are responsible for the material you missed</b>&mdash;get the notes from your classmates and study group and make sure that you understand the material that you missed.</p>


                    <h2>Exams:</h2> 
<p>There will three midterm exams and one final exam during the semester. The exams will be one-hour long (held at the beginning of class, followed by new lecture material) and you will be required to use your graphing calculator (TI-&le;86). There will be <b>no make-up exam</b> except in the case of a documented emergency. In the event of an unavoidable conflict with the midterm (an athletic meet, wedding, funeral, etc...), you must notify me <b>at least one week</b> before the date of the exam so that we can arrange for you to take the exam <b>BEFORE</b> the actual exam date.</p>


                    <h2>Grading Scheme: </h2>
<p>Your grade will be based on homework, class participation, and your exams.  Each component of your grade is calculated independently; then all pieces are combined using the following weighted average.

<blockquote>
Class Participation: 10%
<br>Online Homework: 10%
<br>Exam 1: 15%
<br>Exam 2: 20%
<br>Exam 3: 20%
<br>Final Exam: 25%
</blockquote></p>
                    
                    <h2>Math Lab:</h2>
<p>The Math department sponsors the Math Lab in Kiely 331, where you can find lecture videos, computers, and tutors.  The schedule this semester is TBD.</p>

                    <h2>Math Lounge:</h2>
<p>The Math department has a lounge open to math students and faculty on the fifth floor of Kiely Tower. (The room number is 508.)  This is a great place to meet with your groupmates to chat about math and have blackboard space for working through ideas.  Feel free to take advantage of this comfortable studying space!</p>

                    <h2>Office Hours:</h2>
<p>I am happy to help you with your homework and other class-related questions during my office hours.  I have official office hours as posted on <a href="../../../schedule/15fa.html">my schedule</a>. In addition, you are welcome to make an appointment or stop by my office in Kiely Tower Room 606 at any time. (You can call 718-997-5964 to see if I'm there.) </p>

                    <h2>Cheating/Plagiarism: </h2>
<p>DON'T DO IT!   It makes me very mad and very frustrated when students cheat.  Cheating is the quickest way to lose the respect that I have for each student at the beginning of the semester.  Both receiving and supplying the answers on an exam is cheating.  I take cheating very seriously. If you cheat, you will receive a zero for the homework/exam and I will report you to the academic integrity committee in the Office of Student Affairs to be placed on your permanent file.  If you cheat twice, you will receive a zero for the class.</p>

<center><b><font color="red">**Please do realize that working together on homework as described above is not cheating.**</font></b></center>
<br>

                    <h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: </h2>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should register with and provide documentation to the Office of Special Services, Frese Hall, Room 111. The Office of Special Services will provide a letter for you to bring to your instructor indicating the need for accommodation and the nature of it. <b>This should be done during the first week of class.</b>  For more information about services available to Queens College students, contact the Office of Special Services (718-997-5870) or visit their website (<a href="http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/">http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/</a>).  If you need special accommodation for an exam, you MUST contact me <b>at least one week beforehand</b>.</p>
        
                    <h2>Course Evaluations</h2>
<p>During the final four weeks of the semester, you will be asked to complete an evaluation for this course by filling out an online questionnaire. Please remember to participate in these course evaluations. Your comments are highly valued, and these evaluations are an important service to fellow students and to the institution, since your responses will be pooled with those of other students and made available online, in the Queens College Course Information System (<a href="http://courses.qc.cuny.edu">http://courses.qc.cuny.edu</a>). Please also note that all responses are completely anonymous; no identifying information is retained once the evaluation has been submitted.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Support</h2>
<p>The Queens College Helpdesk (<a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/">http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/</a>, (718) 997-4444, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu">helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu</a>) is located in the I-Building, Room 151 and provides technical support for students who need help with Queens College email, CUNY portal, Blackboard, and CUNYfirst.</p>
