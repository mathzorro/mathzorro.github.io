    <li>Log onto <a href="http://www.webassign.net/">WebAssign</a>. You must have access to WebAssign for this class.  If you do not have access from a previous class, head over to purchase the book &amp; access to webassign <a href="http://www.cengagebrain.com/course/2033830">online from the publisher</a>.  I suggest one of the first two options.  The first option is for access to WebAssign and a copy of the e-book.  The second option is for access to WebAssign along with a physical book, and it also includes access to the e-book.  You will need the class key <b><font color="#059">qc 6174 1546</font></b>.</li>
    <li>On <a href="http://www.webassign.net/">WebAssign</a>, complete the Homework Assignment for Section 3.7. You have ten tries to get the questions correct.  If you feel shaky or get many incorrect, you should <i>strongly</i> consider taking Math 141 instead of Math 142.</li>
    <li>Email me at <a href="mailto:chanusa@qc.cuny.edu">chanusa@qc.cuny.edu</a> with the following four things.: (1) Your name, (2) Your class (Math 142 at 1:40 <b>OR</b> Math 142 at 3:10) (3) the email address where you are best contacted, (4) your graduation year.</li>
    <li>Thoroughly read the class web page including the syllabus and schedule. This should answer all the questions that you may have about the class. Next, take the <b>syllabus quiz</b> on <a href="http://www.webassign.net/">WebAssign</a>.  <b>Retake the quiz</b> as many times as necessary to earn a score of 100%.</li>
    <li>Read through Section 3.7 to revisit the material from Monday.  Skim through Appendix B: Sigma Notation to prepare for the lecture material on Wednesday.</li>

Before you meet with your classmates, look through <a href="homework/StudyTips.pdf">this checklist</a> and think about all the ways in which you have studied for math classes in the past.  Talk with your classmates about the ways you have studied for math classes in the past.  Write a paragraph discussing which of these methods have been the most fruitful in the past and why.  Also choose one NEW study technique that you (and your classmates) will try to use this semester, and include this in your paragraph too!  Also write down the name of the people you met with and when you met!  I will collect this writeup in class.  This is the third of four weekly group work paragraphs that will count toward Standard M4.</li>

        I ask that you write a letter to future students of Math 142. If you think back to the beginning of the the semester, what would have been nice to know about this class that you know now?  How would you explain the class to an incoming student?  What advice do you have for someone just starting in Math 142?  

      <br>&nbsp;<br>You should email me this letter to future students by the night of Wednesday 12/13 at the very latest. Please write your letter in the body of the email; DO NOT create a Word file.  Your letter should be two or more paragraphs long (each paragraph should be 5-7 sentences).  If you submit this to me, then you will increase your final exam grade by 10 points.  And perhaps your letter will be read by students the next time I teach this class!</li>
