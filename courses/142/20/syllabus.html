                    <p><b>Course:</b> Math 142 (Section 01), Spring 2020. 
                    <br><b>Instructor:</b> Prof. Chris (Christopher Hanusa) &mdash; <b>Email:</b> chanusa@qc.cuny.edu &mdash; <b>Office:</b> Kiely Tower, Room 606 
                    <br><b>Meeting Times:</b> Mondays and Wednesdays 1:40&ndash;2:55 in KY 283.
                    <br><b>Course Web Site:</b> http://qc.edu/~chanusa/courses/142/20/

                    </p>


                    <h2>Course goals:</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, students will become proficient in a given <a href="standards.html">set of standards</a>.  In particular, students are expected to:

    <ol>
        <li>Recall key techniques from integral calculus and be able to apply them to unfamiliar examples.</li>
        <li>Recall the statements, consequences, and applications of main definitions and theorems.</li>  
        <li>Develop familiarity with theory and evaluation of sums, integrals, and applications of integrals.</li>
        <li>Develop the ability to work productively on mathematics with others.</li>
        <li>Develop techniques for succeeding in college classes, especially in mathematics.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

                    <h2>Homework Policy:</h2>
<p>DO IT! You can not expect to learn calculus without practice.  I've chosen the homework assignments on WebWork to help you practice calculation questions and also test your understanding of theoretical aspects of calculus.  Your success in this class will depend on your facility with both of these aspects of calculus.  Homework assignments will be posted on the course website the week beforehand.  We will be spending some time in class discussing questions you have from the homework.  If you have more questions, do visit the <b>Math Help Room</b> in Kiely 331 or come to my office hours in Kiely Tower Room 606!</p>

                
                    <h2>Study Groups: </h2>
<p>An important component of your learning in this class is through study groups. Study groups allow you to learn the intricacies of the material; discussion of problems often lead to better understanding and new and more efficient ways to solve the problems.  One of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else; misunderstandings that you never knew you had will appear under someone else's questioning!  In addition, seeing that others also struggle with the material helps to put your own level of understanding in a better perspective and will hopefully reduce some of your anxiety.  If you can not find a study group, e-mail me so that I can help you get involved.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I assume that you will be working in groups when I make up the homework assignments. At the beginning the problems will seem easy enough to plug and chug on your own, but as the quarter progresses the questions become quite complex indeed. When a group works on a problem, everyone can participate. <b>However, I suggest that you take time to digest and write up solutions to the problems on your own.</b></p>

                
<h2>Standards, Assessments, and Reassessments: </h2>
<p>This semester your final grade will be based on a grading system called "Mastery Grading". In essence, your grade will depend on your proficiency with a set of <a href="standards.html">course standards</a>.  The goal for this system is that your grade will be based on how well you have mastered the material, and not on how well you do on a small number of high-stakes midterm exams.  This makes <b>you</b> in charge of your grade and not "the exam". </p>
                
<p>As part of this grading system, you will have multiple opportunities to show your mastery of each standard.  There will be 6&ndash;8 assessments throughout the semester, which will assess standards that have been covered in class up to that point.  For each question you will be given one of the following scores that reflects your ability to address the standard, as follows:
        
First I ask myself:

    <center><font size=+1>Does this work demonstrate understanding of the concept?  <br>and <br>Does this work meet the expectations outlined in the assignment?</font></center>
    
If it does, then depending on how complete and clearly communicated your work is, you will receive one of the following scores:
    
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #17A;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Exemplary</td>
    <td>The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete. Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no non-trivial errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #17A;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>M&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Meets Expectations</td>
    <td>Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

If it does not, then you have not demonstrated understanding of the concept.  In this case, I will determine if you show partial understanding, and you will receive one of the following scores:
                
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #17A;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Revision Needed</td>
    <td>Partial understanding of the material is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/ore improved explanations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #17A;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Not Assessable</td>
    <td>Not enough information is present in the work to determine if there is understanding of the concepts.  Work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions.  Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.</td>
</tr>
</table>                

<p>Every week you will have the option to reassess <b>up to two</b> standards of <b>your</b> choosing.  You can make an appointment to reassess during office hours or at another time that we schedule together.</p>

<p>If you wish to reassess a standard, let me know by email by Sunday evening at the latest.  In this email, you must include:
    <ol>
        <li>A subject line that says: Reassessment Request for (your name) </li>
        <li>Your name<!-- and your section (either MW 1:45 or MW 3:10)--></li>
        <li>The standard number(s) for which you wish to improve your score.</li>
        <li>When you are planning to come for your reassessment.</li>
        <li>A one-sentence explanation why you think you did poorly on the standard the previous time.</li>
        <li>A one-sentence explanation about how you will work to improve your score before the reassessment.</li>
</ol>

I will reply to confirm your reassessement.</p>

<h2>Final Exam:</h2>
<p>Every student in Math 142 at Queens College takes the uniform final exam.  This semester it will be on Friday, May 15 at 8:00am, location to be determined.  I see this as an opportunity for you to revisit the standards from the semester.  The grade you earn on the final exam will count toward your semester grade as described below.</p>
            
<h2>Your semester grade:</h2>            
<p>At the end of the semester, the contribution to your final grade from standards will be based on the following rubric:                          
    <table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><center>Semester<br>Grade</center></td> 
    <td><center>Standard Scores</center></td>
    <td><center>WebWork<br>Grade</center></td>
    <td><center>Final Exam<br>Grade</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><font size=+2><center>A&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></td> 
    <td>You earn M or higher on 90% of the standards (including all <b>core</b> standards)<br>You earn an E or higher on 60% of the standards and you earn no N scores.</td>
    <td><center>&ge; 80%</center></td>
    <td><center>&ge; 80%</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><font size=+2><center>B&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></td> 
    <td>You earn M or higher on 80% of the standards (including all <b>core</b> standards)<br>You earn an E or higher on 25% of the standards and you earn no N scores.</td>
    <td><center>&ge; 70%</center></td>
    <td><center>&ge; 70%</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><font size=+2><center>C&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></td> 
    <td>You earn M or higher on 70% of the standards (incl. 90% of <b>core</b> standards)<br>You earn at most 4 N scores.</td>
    <td><center>&ge; 60%</center></td>
    <td><center>&ge; 60%</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><font size=+2><center>D&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></td> 
    <td>You earn M or higher on 60% of the standards (incl. 80% of <b>core</b> standards)<br>You earn at most 8 N scores.</td>
    <td><center>&ge; 50%</center></td>
    <td><center>&ge; 50%</center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><font size=+2><center>F&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></td> 
    <td>You do not satisfy the "D" standard requirements.</td>
    <td><center>&le; 50%</center></td>
    <td><center>&le; 50%</center></td>
</tr>
</table>

Plus (+) and Minus (&ndash;) grades will be based on your proximity to these full letter grades. 
</p>
    
<p>In every assessment and reassessment, you will be able to use your (TI-&le;86) graphing calculator  (A TI-Nspire is <b>NOT</b> allowed). In the event of a conflict with the assessment (an athletic meet, wedding, funeral, etc...), let me know before its date so that we can arrange for you to take the assessment <b>BEFORE</b> the actual date.</p>


    
            
                <h2>In-Class Participation:</h2>
<p>Succeeding in this class will require your attendance and participation. A great way to participate is to ask questions. A question as simple as "I don't really understand how/why you did X; can you explain it in a different way?" is a great question to ask and it shows that you are involved in the class.  You should participate in the in-class activities, including worksheets, our group discussions, and other interactive features.</p>

<p>If you miss a class, <b>you are responsible for the material you missed</b>&mdash;get the notes from your classmates and study group and make sure that you understand the material that you missed.</p>

                    
                    <h2>Math Lab:</h2>
<p>The Math department sponsors the Math Lab in Kiely 331, where you can find lecture videos, computers, and tutors to help you with your homework, starting the second week of class.</p>

                    <h2>Office Hours:</h2>
<p>I am happy to help you with your homework and other class-related questions during my office hours.  I have official office hours as posted on <a href="../../../schedule/20sp.html">my schedule</a>. In addition, you are welcome to make an appointment or stop by my office in Kiely Tower 606 at any time. (You can call 718-997-5964 to see if I'm there.) </p>

                    <h2>Cheating/Plagiarism: </h2>
<p>DON'T DO IT!   It makes me very mad and very frustrated when students cheat.  Cheating is the quickest way to lose the respect that I have for each student at the beginning of the semester.</p>

<p>Both receiving and supplying the answers on an assessment is cheating. Sharing the content of a reassessment with another student is cheating.</p>
    
<p>On the other hand, working together on homework is <u>encouraged</u> and is certainly not considered cheating.</p>
                        
<p>I take cheating very seriously. If you cheat, you will receive a zero for the assessment and I will report you to the academic integrity committee in the Office of Student Affairs to be placed on your permanent file.  If you cheat twice, you will receive a zero for the class.</p>
        

<h2>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: </h2>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should register with and provide documentation to the Office of Special Services, Frese Hall, room 111. The Office of Special Services will provide a letter for you to bring to your instructor indicating the need for accommodation and the nature of it. <b>This should be done during the first week of class.</b>  For more information about services available to Queens College students, contact the Office of Special Services (718-997-5870) or visit their website (<a href="http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/">http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/oss/</a>).  If you need special accommodation for an exam, you MUST contact me <b>at least one week beforehand</b>.</p>
        

                    <h2>Technical Support</h2>
<p>The Queens College Helpdesk (<a href="http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/">http://www.qc.cuny.edu/computing/</a>, (718) 997-4444, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu">helpdesk@qc.cuny.edu</a>) is located in the I-Building, Room 151 and provides technical support for students who need help with Queens College email, CUNY portal, Blackboard, and CUNYfirst.</p>
