    <li>By 11:59pm: <font color="#059"><b>Bonus Point Opportunity:</b> Letter to Future Students</font>.   
        
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        I ask that you write a letter to future students of Math 142. If you think back to the beginning of the the semester, what would have been nice to know about this class that you know now?  How would you explain the class to an incoming student?  What advice do you have for someone just starting in Math 142?  

      <br>&nbsp;<br>You should email me this letter to future students by the night of Wednesday 12/13 at the very latest. Please write your letter in the body of the email; DO NOT create a Word file.  Your letter should be two or more paragraphs long (each paragraph should be 5-7 sentences).  If you submit this to me, then you will increase your final exam grade by 10 points.  And perhaps your letter will be read by students the next time I teach this class!</li>
