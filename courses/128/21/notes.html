<div class="defn"><span style="color: #A00; font-size: 14pt">Class on Monday 9/20 will be online in the same Zoom Room as before.</span></div>
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>There are two things to complete before class&mdash;Assessment 1 and starting to experiment for Project 1.</li>
    <li>Complete <a href="homework/m128fa21a01.pdf">Assessment 1 on Standards 2&ndash;4</a>.  Use a <b>different piece of paper</b> for each standard. Remember: I care much more that you are able to <b>explain your own understanding</b> than whether you provide the correct answer.</li>
    <li>Next, submit your assessment through Gradescope.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>First, go to <a href="https://gradescope.com">gradescope.com</a> and create an account.  (Click "Sign Up", which takes you to the bottom of the screen; click "Student", and enter code ZR5BX3.)
            </li>
            <li>Upload pictures of your work for <b>each</b> of Standards 2, 3, and 4.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>I've recorded some videos about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqkcBUFTja4&list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp&index=1">creating mathematical art using Desmos</a>. <b>Watch the first video.</b> Here is the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q5znb3fmwl">Desmos notebook</a> from the video.</li>
    <li>As a first step toward the artwork you will be creating for <a href="project.html">Project 1</a>, it's time for YOU to do some experimenting with Desmos and share your discoveries with the class. (<b>By the way, I highly recommend working together with classmates on these tasks!!!</b>  I understand that some people may find this assignment challenging, so it will be helpful to have input from someone else who is working on something similar, in order to ask each other questions as you go along.)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In addition to the list of parent functions we discussed, you may want to explore this this <a href="https://support.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/212235786-Supported-Functions">List of supported functions in Desmos</a>, including arctan(x), sign(x), floor(x), x^(2/3), x^(-2), x!, <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jxzs8fz9qr">the Normal Distribution</a>, (ax+b)/(cx+d), and piecewise-defined functions.</li>
        <li>You should explore what happens when you add or multiply two different functions together. For example, try out arctan(x)+sin(x) and x*floor(x). Then explore compositions of functions. For example, try out floor(4 sin(x)) and abs(10-abs(5-abs(x)))</li>
        <li>Once you have a shape that works for you, save the notebook.  You should be creating many different notebooks, one for each seed of an idea you wish to explore.</li>
        <li>You should be expanding past your comfort zone. You have the permission to go wild! You have the permission to try something new. You have the permission to fail at what you are trying to do. Try to make something that looks awful. Try to make something that surprises you.</li>
        <li>Share the most interesting example you were able to come up with in the Daily Question for September 20 on <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/">Campuswire</a>. Make sure to include a screenshot alongside the link to your Desmos notebook.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="date">Wednesday, September 22</div> 
<div class="defn"><span style="color: #A00; font-size: 14pt">Class on Wednesday 9/22 will be online in the same Zoom Room as before.</span></div>                    
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Here are two Desmos activities that encourage you to explore basic ways to assemble multiple copies of a function: <a href="https://student.desmos.com/activitybuilder/student-greeting/613a5caee3142269e1f3fd06">Line Art</a> and <a href="https://student.desmos.com/activitybuilder/student-greeting/613a5cfc097da75a09ccc5a3">Parabola Art</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLSx1wxrMY&list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp&index=2">The second video in my playlist</a> explains how you can go about experimenting with multiple copies of a function.</li>
    <li>Now you try it. Start with the seeds of functions that you created for Monday's class or start new compositions in Desmos. Then use the algorithmic techniques that we discussed in class on Monday or are in the videos above to make multiple transformed copies of the same base function. Save the results in new Desmos notebooks. (You will be creating many different Desmos notebooks!)  </li>
    <li>Heads up: By Monday, your goal will be to draft <b>five initial sketches</b> that could form the basis for your final piece of art, so you should already be creating a few different sketches for today.</li>
</ul>
                    
<div class="defn">In class: </div>
<ul>
    <li>Groupwork about elements of art and mathematical functions.</li>
</ul> 

    
    
<!--        <li>I've compiled a <a href="terms.html">list of terms</a> that might describe a piece of art.</li> -- >
    </ul>
    <li>As a first step toward the artwork you will be creating for <a href="project.html">Project 1</a>, complete the following steps:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Your goal is to draft <b>five different initial sketches</b> that could form the basis for your final piece of art.</li>
        <li>You can start these sketches on paper if you like, however it is very important that you work to translate your ideas into mathematical functions and display them in Desmos.</li>
        <li>You may find it helpful to think about the visual properties you are going for in your sketches, similar to the groupwork we did in class on Wednesday 9/23.  Feel free to use the resources above to find some words to describe the properties that you want to explore.  Write those words down so you can remember them later.

        <li><a href="http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf">The Principles of Design</a> from the Getty Museum.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As you read through the list of different elements of art and principles of design that are assigned, contribute to the Daily Question for 9/27 on our <a href="https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/">Blackboard</a> Discussion Board by sharing three different qualities that you are excited about exploring as you develop your own artwork.  Expand on why they are exciting and share examples of artwork in the wild that has such qualities that you might try to emulate.</li>
    <li>As a first step toward the artwork you will be submitting for <a href="project.html">Project 1</a>, complete the following steps:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Your goal is to draft <b>five different initial sketches</b> that could form the basis for your final piece of art.</li>
        <li>You can start these sketches on paper if you like, however it is very important that you work to translate your ideas into mathematical functions and display them in Desmos. You can build on the ideas you developed last week or start anew because you want to build on new ideas that you have had or you have seen others use.</li>
        <li>You may find it helpful to think about the visual properties you are going for in your sketches, similar to the groupwork we did in class on Wednesday 9/22.  Feel free to use the resources above to find some words to describe the properties that you want to explore.  Write those words down so you can remember them later. (More words: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles">HERE</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/245361223/principles-of-art-principles-of-art-flash-cards/">HERE</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/197282343/repitition-contrast-and-emphasis-flash-cards/">HERE</a>.)</li>
        <li>You should use Desmos as a sketchpad. Start off with a parent function (or a couple), and use the techniques from class to modify and combine the functions to a desired shape and size.</li>
        <li>Once you have an initial shape that works for you, save the notebook.  You should be creating many different notebooks, one for each seed of the drawings you wish to explore.</li>
        <li>Given this initial shape, start to introduce parameters that transform the initial shape, following the steps in the Youtube tutorial I posted before about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp">using Desmos to create Mathematical Art</a>.</li>
        <li>Once you have tweaked your sketches sufficiently that you are happy that each sketch matches the idea you are aiming for, export the five sketches to five SVG files. (Here is a video that shows how: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcRhGozRr4&list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp&index=5">exporting your artwork to SVG</a>.)</li>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/">our class Blackboard page</a> and click on "Groups". You should be a member of a room that says "Project 1 Artwork Critique Group X" that matches the group you were in on Wednesday.  Go into this group and click on "Group Discussion Board". There will be a forum there. Create a Thread that has your name as the Thread Subject. Post your five SVG files to this thread <b>before class</b>. I am expecting five draft artworks from every person, each with its own style. If for some reason you have fewer than five images, post the ones you DO have before class, and post the remaining ones later.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>I highly recommend working together with classmates on these tasks.  I understand that some people may find this assignment challenging, so it will be helpful to have input from someone else who is working on something similar, in order to ask each other questions as you go along.</li>
