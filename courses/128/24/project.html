                    <h2 style="color: #980">Overview</h2>

                    <p>This class involves being creative with mathematics and realizing your creativity by creating pen plotter art.  There will be three main projects throughout the semester and a final portfolio for you to assemble, discuss, and display your artwork in a group setting.</p>

                    <p>The work that you submit for each project will be only one piece of art. However, as you work on your submission, you will be creating other pieces which serve as practice pieces or which explore other possible avenues that could have led to a submission.  <b>It is important to keep these unsubmitted works too.</b>  They will help you explain your process and your <b>intentionality</b> in the essay that is part of each project.</p> 
                    
                    <p>As a rule of thumb, make sure that you keep <b>3</b>&ndash;<b>5 additional pieces of art</b> from each project.  You will include these artworks in the final portfolio you create at the end of the semester.  Furthermore, looking at all your artwork together will help you discuss your artistic evolution throughout the semester. </p>

                    <b>The art that you create must:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be developed through an intentional Double Diamond Design Process.</li>
                        <li>Be designed in Desmos and realized on the AxiDraw pen plotter.</li>
                        <li>Be constructed from snippets of one or more parent functions. These snippets shall be derived by introducing parameters and adjusting the values of these parameters intentionally through Desmos's sliders.</li>

                    <b>The one-to-two-page lab report must:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide key details about your artwork. Discuss the process you went through from conception to final result, including challenges and successes. Provide clarity about the mathematical and artistic choices you made using appropriately technical language. Discuss challenges and successes with the AxiDraw machine. Discuss the revision process and reflect on how you might want to push this work further if you had more time. See below for more details about the evaluation rubric.</li>
                        <li>Be written in a clear and organized manner, using full sentences and proper English.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use 1 inch margins, 1.5x spacing, and 11-point Times New Roman font.  (Your report will be approximately 500-800 words.)
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Include a separate cover page</b> with an image of your artwork, the title of your artwork, your name, and the date.<br>(<i>This page does not count toward your one-to-two pages.</i>)</li>

                        <li><strong>Gain Expertise by Tuesday, February 13:</strong> 
                            <p>By this day, you should have gained expertise with all the skills necessary to complete the project.  This includes understanding function transformations, using Desmos to graph functions, incorporating function parameters and sliders into your Desmos graph, creating lists in Desmos, and incorporating lists into your parameters to create multiple transformed copies of your function.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Explore Possibilities by Tuesday, February 20:</strong> 
                            <p>By this day you should be exploring different properties that your artwork might have.  Smooth? Angular? Linear? Periodic? Regular? Irregular? Intersecting? Asymptotic? Will you focus on the Negative space? Positive space? Save at least three different compositions and bring them to class to discuss.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Due on Thursday, February 29:</strong> 
                            <p>By this date, you are expected to have completed your project including the lab report. You will complete a peer review activity with classmates on this day.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project Revision Submitted on Tuesday, March 4:</strong> 
                            <p>By this day, turn in your project before class through the links provided on our Course Content page.  Make sure to save and keep track of three to five other pieces to add to your final portfolio later in the semester. (Put them in a location that you can find easily later.) </p>

<p>You will be assigned a score for each criterion on an E-M-R-N scale as follows.</p>

                
<p>First I ask myself:</p>

    <center><font size=+2><span style="color: #980">Does this work meet the expectations outlined in the criterion?</span></font></center>
    
    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does,</b></span> then depending on how complete and clearly communicated your work is, you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
    
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Exemplary</td>
    <td>The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete.  Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no non-trivial errors in understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>M&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Meets Expectations</td>
    <td>Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does not,</b></span> then you have not demonstrated understanding of the concept.  In this case, I will determine if you show partial understanding, and you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
                
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Revision Needed</td>
    <td>Partial understanding of the material is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Not Assessable</td>
    <td>Not enough information is present in the work to determine if there is understanding of the concepts.  Work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions.  Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.</td>
</tr>
</table>      
                    
<p>Your final project grade will be based on the number of scores at each level as follows.</p>

<p>Every E grade corresponds to 100%, every M grade corresponds to 90%, every R grade corresponds to 50%, and every N grade corresponds to 0%. These scores are then combined using a weighted average corresponding to the percentages listed above.</p>

<p>You will be assigned a score for each criterion on an E-M-R-N scale as follows.</p>

                
<p>First I ask myself:</p>

    <center><font size=+2><span style="color: #980">Does this work meet the expectations outlined in the criterion?</span></font></center>
    
    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does,</b></span> then depending on how complete and clearly communicated your work is, you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
    
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Exemplary</td>
    <td>The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete.  Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no non-trivial errors in understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>M&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Meets Expectations</td>
    <td>Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does not,</b></span> then you have not demonstrated understanding of the concept.  In this case, I will determine if you show partial understanding, and you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
                
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Revision Needed</td>
    <td>Partial understanding of the material is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Not Assessable</td>
    <td>Not enough information is present in the work to determine if there is understanding of the concepts.  Work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions.  Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.</td>
</tr>
</table>      
                    
<p>Your final project grade will be based on the number of scores at each level as follows.</p>

<p>Every E grade corresponds to 100%, every M grade corresponds to 90%, every R grade corresponds to 50%, and every N grade corresponds to 0%. These scores are then combined using a weighted average corresponding to the percentages listed above.</p>

        <p>The culmination of the semester is a portfolio that details your journey this semester becoming a mathematical artist.  You have learned about transformations of functions, polar functions, parametric functions, elements of art and design, gained skills with Desmos, Inkscape, AxiDraw, the Makerspace, and a completely different machine!  It is time to assemble the story of this journey into a writeup and presentation and share it with us.</p>



        <h2 style="color: #980">Specifications</h2>
                    
        <p><b>The final product of this portfolio will consist of:</b>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A physical portfolio is a collection of images and text assembled in a physical format. There are official "studio art portolios", but this can be also achieved using a binder and sheet protectors that a viewer can flip through. </li>
                        <li>A digital portfolio is hosted on a website, such as <a href="https://padlet.com/">Padlet</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/">Wordpress</a>, <a href="https://cargo.site/">Cargo</a>, <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/students">Squarespace</a>, or <a href="https://portfolio.adobe.com/">Adobe Portfolio</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <li><b>Include images that form a coherent story</b>, including your submitted artwork from Projects 1, 2, and 3, images that inspired your submitted artwork, images that you developed for your projects but did not lead to the submitted artwork, images that show your progress as an artist, images that show your progress as a mathematician, and images that convey the feelings you experienced during this class. (If you are creating a physical portfolio, you will need to print out these images to include in the portfolio.)</li>
                <li><b>Include text that explains how each of the included images figures into this semester's journey.</b></li>
<!--                <li><b>Pass through a critiquing and peer review process.</b></li>-->
                <li><b>Be able to be shared in class on Presentation Day.</b></li>

            <b>The two-to-three page semester reflection must:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Discuss Your Progress as a Mathematician, Artist, and Maker.</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think back to where you started this semester and think about where you are now. What has changed, and what about this semester's journey has led to this transformation?</li>

                <li><b>Include additional reflections about this semester and this course.</b></li>
                <li><b>Supplement the portfolio.</b> <p>Feel free to refer to images and other parts of your physical or digital portfolio.</p></li>
                <li><b>Use 1 inch margins, 1.5x spacing, and 11-point Times New Roman font.</b>
                        </li>
                <li><b>Include a cover page</b> with title, your name, and the date.<br>(<i>This page does not count toward your 2-to-3 pages. This information should not be repeated on the other pages of the report.</i>)</li>
            </ul>
                    
            <b>The presentation must:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Introduce yourself.</b></li>

                <li><b>Be organized and rehearsed.</b>  
                    <p>You need to make sure that you have practiced what you are going to say a couple of times.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Respect the time limit.</b>  
                    <p>Three to five minutes is a very short amount of time!  This means you really need to have practiced multiple times so that you use your time efficiently.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Be prepared and ready to go on our presentation day!</b></li>
