<div class="date">Thursday, February 1</div> 

<div class="defn"><span style="color: #980;">Class today will be held in the library. We will meet in Rosenthal Library Room 227 at our normal class time. This room is on Floor 2 of the Library. After you enter the library, take the main staircase one flight down, turn left, continue along the wall to your left until you find the room. Please make sure you are ON TIME!!!</span></div>

</ul>


<div class="defn">Homework:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have completed all Desmos Activities up until this point, including the Desmos Activities for "Day 01" and "Day 02".</li>
    <li>Before <b>Tuesday, February 6</b>, do some internet searching and browsing for cool things people have done with pen plotters (of which the AxiDraw is one type) and with mathematical art. Here are some places you might find inspiration:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore artists who use the pen plotter: Michelle Chandra, Raphael Gadot, Julien Gachadoat, Matthew Hughes, Daniel Catt, Ruud de Rooij, Kenny Vaden, Pablo Azocar, Tom Jordan, ... </li>
        <li>Explore various hashtags on social media: #penplotter #axidraw #plottertwitter #mathart</li>
        <li>See @penplotart on Instagram for curated pen plotter art from different artists</li>
        <li>Visit Drawing Bots to see what other #plotterart people have programmed. https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/tools</li>
        <li>Explore on your own&ndash;I'd love to see what you can find. A video? An interpretive dance? ceramics? There are many ways that people can be creative with pen plotters / making / mathematical art.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>When you have found something that inspires you, post in the Week 03 - Inspiration channel on Teams</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Share the picture(s) you found.</li>
        <li>Share a link to the page where you found the picture(s).</li>
        <li>Add a sentence or two that explains why you chose those picture(s).</li>
        <li>Leave a comment on one or more classmates' posts that speak to you.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Before <b>Thursday, February 8</b>, meet for <b>at least one hour</b> outside of classtime with <b>at least one other classmate</b>.  
    <ul>
        <li>Work together to make a basic drawing on paper using the AxiDraw machine. The actual drawing that you make is not important. In fact, the simpler the drawing the better for this exercise.</li>
        <li>Help each other to make sure <b>each person</b> in your group completes <b>ALL the steps</b> of the process individually. (This involves: Make a drawing in Desmos, Export it to an SVG file, Import the SVG file into Inkscape, Use the AxiDraw to draw it.) By the end of this process, everyone should have had practice with every step.</li>
        <li>If you have time left over, help each other with the other parts of this homework assignment too.</li>
        <li>After your meeting write one paragraph about something that you learned or experienced that you would not have if you had worked alone. Also write down the name of the person you met with and when you met!</li>
        <li>On Thursday, bring your drawing and paragraph to class to turn in.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Practice the techniques from Tuesday's activities with an eye toward creating something you might use for <a href="project.html">the first project</a>. Do the following.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a function whose graph has a shape you like.</li>
            <li><b>Restrict the domain</b> of your function so you have a "snippet" of the graph.</li>
            <li>Insert h and k's into your equation(s) so that you are able to translate the "snippet" using a slider. <b>Make sure the slider works correctly</b> before going on to the next step.</li>
            <li>Use the techniques from the last homework assignment to "save the data" of your translated snippets.</li>
            <li>Create two lists, H and K, for the data. The list H should contain the horizontal translation data and the list K should contain the vertical translation data.</li>
            <li>Replace the "h and k" parameters by the "H and K" lists and all your curves will appear together.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Discussion of the <a href="project.html">Project 1</a> Rubric</li>
    <li>This week and next you are going to go through the steps of the Double Diamond Design Model to create your first project.</li>
    <li>First, work on <b>Discovery</b>. Draft <b>three different initial sketches</b> that could form the basis for your final piece of art. You are exploring the mathematical space to see what tools speak the most to you.</li>
    <li>You can start these sketches on paper if you like, however it is very important that you work to translate your ideas into mathematical functions and display them in Desmos.</li>
    <li>You are encouraged to work with your neighbor and ask Prof. Hanusa questions about accomplishing what you want to accomplish.</li>
    <li>Next is <b>Define</b>. Decide on <b>one</b> of the initial sketches that you'd like to develop further.</li>
    <li>You're now ready to <b>Develop</b>. This is going to involve some prototyping. What is the best way to assemble the pieces into a scene? You should explore <b>at least three</b> different scenes involving the same mathematical pieces. Get some feedback from classmates, friends, and family.</li>
    <li>Before the next class, use the AxiDraw to print out at least three different scenes. Feel free to use different materials to realize them.</li>
    <li>Reserve a time in the next week to use the AxiDraw machine. Feel free to go with a classmate or two since that's more fun!</li>
</ul>
                    
<div class="defn">Homework:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Complete the steps you started in class.</li>
    <li>Visit the Makerspace and create your three different drawings.</li>
    <li>Create a digital record of your visit to the Makerspace by doing one of the following things:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a picture together with your classmate in the Makerspace.</li>
        <li>Take a selfie with the AxiDraw setup.</li>
        <li>Take a video of your process getting your artwork into Inkscape.</li>
        <li>Take a video of the AxiDraw machine in motion.</li>
        <li>Take a picture of the many pieces of paper you used during the trial and error phase.</li>
        <li>Something else creative involving the time you spent at the Makerspace.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Post your digital record in our Microsoft Team in the <b>Week 05 - In the Makerspace</b> channel.</li>
    <li>As part of your project lab report, you will be reflecting on the creative process of coming up with the ideas from your artwork. Write at least one paragraph (5&ndash;7 sentences) about what you experienced, or what was difficult, or the process you used to complete these first steps. Save this paragraph on your own computer so that you can use it during your writeup. Then submit it as your assignment before class.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Instead make this a paragraph about following the first two steps of the double diamond process. And then a paragraph about the exploration they did of the third step of the process. -->

<!-- Ask them to submit the URLs of their first diamond images. -->

            <li>Develop a polar curve of your own choosing. You may wish to start with a curve from our Desmos Activity "Day 13 - Polar Equations Investigations" or the <a href="http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/skokoska/curves.pdf">Fifty Famous Curves</a> pdf.</li>
            <li>Next, introduce parameters to modify the shape so that it is how you want it to be.</li>
            <li>Then, apply some transformations to the shape, either by translating, dilating, or combining it with another function.</li>
            <li>Think to restrict the domain of your polar function in a thoughtful way.</li>
            <li>Last, Add a second, complementary curve to your image to complete the artwork. This complementary curve can either be a standard function y=f(x), an implicit function, or another polar function.</li>
            <li>There should only be two (carefully crafted) curves in your final image.</li>
        </ol>
    <li>Share your most interesting creation on Teams in the <b>Week 09 - Intentional Polar</b> channel. Make sure you share both a PNG and the URL of your artwork. <span style="color: #980;"><b>Write a sentence or two</b></span> about how you approached this complex and minimalist task.</li>
    <li>Remember: Submit your revised projects by Monday morning.</li>
