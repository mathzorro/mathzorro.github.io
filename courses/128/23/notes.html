<div class="date">Tuesday, February 7</div> 
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have completed all Desmos Activities up until this point, including the Desmos Activity "128 Day 03 - Exploring Functions with Sliders".</li>
    <li>Meet for <b>at least one hour</b> outside of classtime with <b>at least one other classmate</b>.  Your goal is to get together to discuss being creative with Desmos and work to help each other complete the two tasks below. Feel free to use Discord to find a partner (or partners) to work with.<br>&nbsp;<br> After your meeting write one paragraph about something that you learned or experienced that you would not have if you had worked alone. Also write down the name of the person you met with and when you met! I will collect this paragraph in class.<br>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>Task 1. Make functions that have certain properties.</b> Open a new <a href="https://desmos.com/calculator">Desmos worksheet</a>. (Remember to log in!) In the first cell of the worksheet, write your name in a "note" cell. Now, given the experience you gained in class, try to create graphs of five functions whose graphs have the following properties. Feel free to be as creative as possible.  When you have finished, open the Share Dialog, copy the URL that was generated, and <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/PqPiCs698J">submit that URL in this form</a>.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>A line that looks almost vertical.</li>
            <li>A graph with a sharp corner.</li>
            <li>A graph with exactly four bumps.</li>
            <li>Steps going downward.</li>
            <li>A graph that has waves like the ocean but wiggles right and left instead of up and down.</li>
        </ol><br>

    <li><b>Task 2. Be creative with parent functions.</b> Choose at least three different parent functions and at least one implicit function to explore. Type them into your Desmos worksheet and introduce sliders for coefficients, powers, and whatever else you can think to add. Move the sliders until the functions are interesting to you. Make sure you record the values of the sliders and the formula including the numbers (and not variable names) that gave you the graph you liked best.
        
    <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Export</b> and <b>Share</b> your favorite function(s) to our class <a href="https://discord.com">Discord Server</a> (like you did on last Thursday) in the <b>Daily Question for February 7</b> <i>thread</i> in the #functions channel. Explain in a few sentences what about your example you liked.</li>

        <li>Using a list in place of a variable</li>
        <li>Using lists to modify multiple coefficients in a function simultaneously</li>
        <li>Being intentional about the entries of the list</li>

        <li>You should use Desmos as a sketchpad. Start off with a parent function (or a couple), and use the techniques from class to modify and combine the functions to a desired shape and size. Introduce sliders to to modify your parameters so that they are exactly where you want them to be.</li>
        <li>Once you have an initial shape that works for you, save the notebook.  <b>You should be creating many different notebooks, one for each seed of the drawings you wish to explore.</b></li>
        <li>Once you have tweaked your sketches sufficiently that you are happy that each sketch matches the idea you are aiming for, export the three sketches to five SVG files, NOT PNG files. We went over this in class, and here is a video that shows those steps again: (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcRhGozRr4&list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp&index=5">Exporting your artwork to SVG</a>.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bring these to class. I am expecting THREE draft artworks from every person, each with its own style. We will share and discuss these together in class.</li>
    <li>As part of your project lab report, you will be reflecting on the creative process of coming up with the ideas from your artwork. Write at least one paragraph (5&ndash;7 sentences) about what you experienced, or what was difficult, or the process you used to complete these first steps. Save this paragraph on your own computer so that you can use it during your writeup. Then <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/nUcgnVsiMT">submit it here before class</a>. </li>
    <li>Once you have completed the Makerspace Orientation, you are allowed to use the Makerspace whenever it is open. Feel free to explore it at your own pace.</li>

<ul>
    <li>Take some time <i>outside of class</i> to go to the Makerspace and practice using the AxiDraw to generate artwork you designed in Desmos. As you learned earlier this semester, working together with a classmate (a) helps with time mangagement, (b) gives you someone else to help you troubleshoot, and (c) makes the whole process more pleasant. So make a plan to go with someone else! </li>
    <li>Create a digital record of your visit to the Makerspace by doing one of the following things:</li>

            <li>Next, introduce parameters to modify the shape so that it is how you want it to be.</li>
            <li>Then, apply some transformations to the shape, either by translating, dilating, or combining it with another function.</li>
            <li>Last, Add a second, complementary curve to your image to complete the artwork. This complementary curve can either be a standard function y=f(x), an implicit function, or another polar function.</li>

        <li><a href="https://flipgrid.com/c2c6a5a8">Post your video presentation here.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li>You will be assigned five other presentations to watch and comment on (using a video response) and you should choose at least five other presentations to watch.  The list of presentations will be posted on <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/">Campuswire</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Bonus Point Opportunity:</b> You will receive a half-grade increase in this class (for example B &rarr; B+ or C&ndash; &rarr; C) if you complete <a href="https://forms.gle/UbHGXphP2ZqJLWiy5">the following two tasks</a>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>First, I ask that you write a letter to future students of Math 128: Mathematical Design. If you think back to the beginning of the the semester, what would have been nice to know about this class that you know now?  How would you explain the class to an incoming student?  What advice do you have for someone just starting in Math 128? Your letter should be two or more paragraphs long, and each paragraph should be 5&ndash;7 sentences. Perhaps your letter will be read by students the next time I teach this class!</li>
        <li>Next, give props for two presentations that you thought were well done. This feedback will be shared anonymously with those classmates.  It's a nice way to let them know you appreciated their presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Thanks for all your hard work in this class!</li>
</ul>
