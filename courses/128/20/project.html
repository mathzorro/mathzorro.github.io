                    <h2 style="color: #980">Overview</h2>

                    <p>This class involves being creative with mathematics and realizing your creativity by creating digital art.  There will be three main projects throughout the semester and a final portfolio for you to assemble, discuss, and display your artwork in a group setting.</p>

                    <p>The work that you submit for each project will be based around only one image. However, as you work on your submission, you will be creating other images which serve as practice pieces or which explore other possible avenues that could have led to a submission.  <b>It is important to keep these unsubmitted works too.</b>  They will help you to explain your process and your intentionality in the writeup that is part of each project.</p> 
                    
                    <p>As a rule of thumb, make sure that you keep <b>3</b>&ndash;<b>5 additional images</b> from each project.  You will include these images in the final portfolio you create at the end of the semester.  Furthermore, looking at all these images together will help you discuss your artistic evolution throughout the semester. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Timeliness:</li>
            <ul>

<!-- Did you use a table to create a family of transformations? 

(The only issue with this is that all functions in the same family must be the same color.)


-->

<!-- Related parts grouped together into folders, text cells to explain what each part is. -->

            </ul>
            
<!-- Programming methods include: changing colors, tables, sliders,  -->

                <li>Did you follow the writing format requirements?</li>

        </ul>
    
    
        <p>You will be assigned a score for each standard on an E-M-R-N scale as follows.</p>

                
<p>First I ask myself:</p>

    <center><font size=+2><span style="color: #980">Does this work meet the expectations outlined in the standard?</span></font></center>
    
    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does,</b></span> then depending on how complete and clearly communicated your work is, you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
    
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>E&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Exemplary</td>
    <td>The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete.  Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are no non-trivial errors in understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>M&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Meets Expectations</td>
    <td>Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.</td>
</tr>
</table>

    <p><span style="color: #980"><b>If it does not,</b></span> then you have not demonstrated understanding of the concept.  In this case, I will determine if you show partial understanding, and you will receive one of the following scores:</p>
                
<table style="border-collapse: separate;border-spacing: 7px">
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Revision Needed</td>
    <td>Partial understanding of the material is evident, but there are significant gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><span style="color: #980;font-weight: 700"><font size=+2><center>N&nbsp;&nbsp;</center></font></span></td> 
    <td>Not Assessable</td>
    <td>Not enough information is present in the work to determine if there is understanding of the concepts.  Work is fragmentary or contains significant omissions.  Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.</td>
</tr>
</table>      
                    
                
    <p>Your final project grade will be based on the number of scores at each level as follows.<br><i>If you do not participate equally in the groupwork, your grade will be reduced accordingly.</i></p>

                    <p>The culmination of the semester is a portfolio that details your journey this semester becoming a mathematical artist.  You have learned about transformations of functions, parametric functions, elements of art and design, and gained skills with Desmos.
