    <li>As a first step toward the artwork you will be creating for <a href="project.html">Project 1</a>, complete the following steps:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Your goal is to draft five different initial sketches that could form the basis for your final piece of art.</li>
        <li>You can start these sketches on paper if you like, however it is very important that you work to translate your ideas into mathematical functions and display them in Desmos.</li>
        <li>You may find it helpful to think about the visual properties you are going for in your sketches, similar to the groupwork we did in class on Wednesday 9/23.  Feel free to use the resources above to find some words to describe the properties that you want to explore.  Write those words down so you can remember them later. (More words: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles">HERE</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/245361223/principles-of-art-principles-of-art-flash-cards/">HERE</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/197282343/repitition-contrast-and-emphasis-flash-cards/">HERE</a>.)</li>
        <li>You should use Desmos as a sketchpad. Start off with a parent function (or a couple), and use the techniques from class to modify and combine the functions to a desired shape and size.</li>
        <li>Once you have an initial shape that works for you, save the notebook.  You should be creating many different notebooks, one for each seed of the drawings you wish to explore.</li>
        <li>Given this initial shape, start to introduce parameters that transform the initial shape, following the steps in the Youtube tutorial I posted before about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp">using Desmos to create Mathematical Art</a>.</li>
        <li>Once you have tweaked your sketches sufficiently that you are happy that each sketch matches the idea you are aiming for, export the five sketches to five SVG files. (Reminder: Video from last time about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOcRhGozRr4&list=PLj76nfNlZz156Sp5W_5SKy-q1UYgowLKp&index=5">exporting your artwork to SVG</a>.)</li>
        <li>Go to Campuswire and click on "Chatrooms". You should be a member of a room that says "artwork-critique-groupX" that matches the group you were in on Wednesday.  Post your five SVG files to this room <b>before class</b>. I am expecting five draft artworks from every person, each with its own style. If you end up with fewer than five, post the ones you have before class, and post the remaining ones later.</li>
        <li>Write one or more paragraphs (5-7 words) reflecting on this process and <a href="https://forms.gle/G2Da2faHv74VMFSE9">submit it here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>I highly recommend working together with classmates on these tasks.  I understand that some people may find this assignment challenging, so it will be helpful to have input from someone else who is working on something similar, in order to ask each other questions as you go along.</li>

    <li><b>Bonus Point Opportunity:</b> You will receive a half-grade increase in this class (for example B &rarr; B+ or C&ndash; &rarr; C) if you complete <a href="https://forms.gle/UbHGXphP2ZqJLWiy5">the following two tasks</a>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>First, I ask that you write a letter to future students of Math 128: Mathematical Design. If you think back to the beginning of the the semester, what would have been nice to know about this class that you know now?  How would you explain the class to an incoming student?  What advice do you have for someone just starting in Math 128? Your letter should be two or more paragraphs long, and each paragraph should be 5&ndash;7 sentences. Perhaps your letter will be read by students the next time I teach this class!</li>
        <li>Next, give props for two presentations that you thought were well done. This feedback will be shared anonymously with those classmates.  It's a nice way to let them know you appreciated their presentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Thanks for all your hard work in this class!</li>
