<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Meet for one hour <b>outside of class</b> with at least one other classmate.   Your goal is to get together to talk about the class so far and compare answers to the homework questions below.  Type up one paragraph (5&ndash;7 sentences) about something that you learned or experienced that you would not have if you had worked alone. <a href="https://forms.gle/QU9fQEg8j6kH6hz4A">Submit your paragraph and the name of the person you met with</a>. This will contribute to your participation grade.</li>
    <li>Read Sections 2.4&ndash;2.8 (pages 13&ndash;18) of <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/">Modeling and Simulation in Python</a>.</li>
    <li>Here is a link to a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hxa6Ube8gnnUH7lmxS28jXbDuQDxPvxD?usp=sharing">Homework Template</a> that you can use to type up your homework this semester. Save a copy to your Google Drive, modify the filename of the notebook, and make sure your name appears at the top. (Remember: To edit a cell, double click.)  You will notice that there are already three Sections (labeled Objects, Comprehension/Vocabulary, and Coding) created and subsections started in each of them (labeled Question 1-1, 1-3, and 1-5) corresponding to the questions below.  Please adhere to this structure in the homework notebook you will be submitting, adding ## subsections as necessary for every question in that # section.  The first video from 2/3 has some pointers about how to do this. Feel free to ask on Campuswire if you are still confused.</li>
    <li><b>Homework Questions:</b> Complete the following homework questions in your homework notebook (that you just created in the previous bulletpoint) and be prepared to discuss them in class. As always, you are welcome to work with classmates on homework questions; just make sure to write up your solutions <b>in your own words</b>.</li>
    <b>Objects</b> (We're creating a dictionary of the objects we encounter.) 
    <ul>
        <li><b>1-1.</b> Write a sentence that explains what a <span style="font-family: monospace">State</span> object is. </li>
        <li><b>1-2.</b> Write a sentence that explains what a <span style="font-family: monospace">TimeSeries</span> object is.  How does it compare to a <span style="font-family: monospace">State</span> object, if at all?</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Comprehension/Vocabulary</b> (Requires some research in the text)
    <ul>
        <li><b>1-3.</b> In the introduction to Chapter 1, the author explains a quality of a model that might be desirable. Copy down the paragraph that starts "But often ". </li>
        <li><b>1-4.</b> Write a short paragraph that explains in your own words what the <span style="font-family: monospace">step(p1,p2)</span> function is doing and why.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Coding</b> (Give your brain and hands some practice.)
    <ul>
        <li><b>1-5.</b> What is the process called that makes the functions defined in modsim.py available to Python?  What is the block of code that accomplishes this?</li>
        <li><b>1-6.</b> How do we read (aka extract the information from) the variables inside a <span style="font-family: monospace">State</span> object? </li>
        <li><b>1-7.</b> Define the function <span style="font-family: monospace">bike_to_olin()</span> and make sure that it works like you expect it to by running it multiple times. Make sure to copy it into your personal chap02 notebook so the rest of the sections work correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Watch the following video lectures on material from Chapter 2. Follow along in the colab notebook you used before.  It will be important to run all the cells and define the <span style="font-family: monospace">bike_to_olin()</span> function correctly.</li>

        <li><b>5-5.</b> <b>(a)</b> Find any webpage that has a table of data that changes <span style="color: firebrick">over time</span>. <b>(b)</b> use the tools we discussed from Chapter 5 to import this data into python with the time column as the index column. <b>(c)</b> Change the column headings to have short, simple names. <b>(d)</b> Choose one column to single out as a Series object, and plot the dataset.

        <li><b>Formulation Error:</b>  Arises from ignoring variables, or over-simplifying the relationships among the variables. </li>
        <li><b>Measurement (or Observation) Error:</b> Arises when data collection, transcription, or reporting is incorrect or imprecise due to laboratory equipment.</li>
        <li><b>Discretization (or Truncation) Errors</b> are due to implementing approximations of the actual dynamics. Our models especially are subject to these due to approximating continuous differential equations using discrete time steps.</li>
        <li><b>Round-off Errors</b> have to do with the fact that our programs don't hold infinitely many digits in their memory. In our case these errors are basically negligible.</li>

    <li>I suggest you take a look at the following article:</li>
    <ul> 
        <li>This article about <a href="https://mae.ufl.edu/haftka/eoed/protected/Error-uncertainty.pdf">Error and uncertainty in modeling and simulation</a> talks about the modeling process and places where errors can occur. Take a look at Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3, which compare historical ways to understand the modeling process and the new way proposed in this article. Figure 4 (page 341) details many different sources of error that have crept into the modeling process and can be helpful for you when you are trying to find sources of error in your own projects.</li>

<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure all of homework assignments 4-8 are in the same notebook.</li>
    <li>Turn in your Colab homework notebook containing Assignments 4&ndash;8 by doing the following:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In your Colab notebook, click on the "Share" button at the top left of the screen.</li>
        <li>In the space where it says "Add people and groups", type in "chanusa@qc.cuny.edu"</li>
        <li><b>Uncheck</b> the box labeled "Notify people" and click "Send" so that I have access to your notebook. This will return you to the notebook screen again.</li>
        <li>Go back and click on the "Share" button again and this time click "Get link".</li>
        <li>Copy the link and paste it in <a href="https://forms.gle/7vULPdiCCwhEyGuB6">this form</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Prepare your homework notebook for submission and <a href="https://forms.gle/7vULPdiCCwhEyGuB6">submit the link here</a>. </li>
    <li>Continue writing Project 3. Finish writing the methodology and results sections and make progress on your analysis section. Remember the focus of the analysis is on your model and how good it is. Have you addressed its positives and negatives?  Have you analyzed the quality of your assumptions? Have you addressed the model's limitations? errors?  How do your results compare with your expectations? How might someone improve the model in the future?</li>
    <li>About your paper's <b>Abstract</b>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The LAST thing you should write for your paper is the abstract. Think of this as an elevator pitch that conveys the essence of your paper, including what you wanted to learn, how you approached learning it, your main results and conclusions. AND it should be no more than 75 words!  The point is to explain to people why they should read your article. Don't forget to put the abstract on your title page.</li>
        <li>I thought you might want to see some <a href="abstracts.html">examples of abstracts</a> so you can see what qualities of an abstract you think are the most powerful.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Start assembling your project content into digital slides for your presentation. The content should follow the same outline as the paper, with more opportunity to discuss (briefly) the process or trials that you went through to get to your final model and conclusions.</li>
