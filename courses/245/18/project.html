                    <h2>Rationale:</h2> 

                    <p>Mathematical Modeling is a unique math class since its goal is to give you the tools necessary to use mathematics outside of school.  The language of mathematical modeling is the language that real-world companies and business managers understand.  If you are trying to convince your boss that she or he should follow a course of action that you suggest, you will need to justify yourself; basing your reasoning on a mathematically-sound model can provide the basis of your justification. </p>
                    
                    <p>In this class, you will be creating two mathematical models based on the material that we learn throughout the semester.  I would like to extend a large thank you to Allen Downey at Olin College who has been extremely generous in providing materials from when he taught this class.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->
                    
                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>You will be creating and analyzing a population dynamics model, using Chapters 5&ndash;8 of the ModSimPy book as your starting point.  The book analyzes various models based on explicit assumptions that have a basis in the real world.  Your project will also relate to population dynamics and be based in real world assumptions, but you will have some choices about the population(s) you model and the type of model you build.  Here are three possible themes to consider:</p>

                    <div class="date">Option A: Further World Population Investigations </div>
                    
                    <p>The first option is to ask and answer an interesting question about the human population on Earth. Most likely, you will take the model developed in the book and either apply it to a different population, or extend it to include additional features, or both. For example, you might identify the regions that will have the biggest effect on future population growth and model them in more detail. Or you might identify factors that have the biggest effect on growth and add them to the model.</p>

                    <p>Search online to find data relevant to the questions you want to answer.  Here are two helpful links:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf">UN DESA Population Division</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/training/online-courses-and-resources/non-certificate-courses-and-mini-tutorials/population-analysis-for-planners/lesson-3/lesson-3-creating-a-demographic-profile">Useful concepts in demography</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <div class="date">Option B: Stochastic Population Models </div>
                    
                    <p>As we saw in the bike share example of Chapters 1 and 2, random processes can lead to a range of predicted outcomes. The main idea of the second project option is to apply this logic to population growth. Instead of a deterministic growth rate, consider a model in which the growth rate for each time period is drawn at random from a probability distribution (which might in turn be estimated from empirical data). This assumption might be motivated by factors that affect the growth rate in ways that vary from year to year, such as the amount of fishing activity in a marine habitat.</p>

                    <p>One of the interesting questions you can address using a stochastic population model is the likelihood of a population dying out (in the sense of extinction for an entire species, or simply collapse to the point that a population in a given area can no longer sustain itself). You do not need to restrict yourself to human populations.  You will find that there is a wealth of information (including time-series data) available for many different species in many areas of the world. For example, if you were interested in fish populations, here are some useful resources:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/esa/listed.htm">NOAA Fisheries – Endangered and Threatened Marine Species</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/region.htm">NOAA Fisheries – Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/all-profiles">FishWatch – U.S. Seafood Facts</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
            
                    <div class="date">Option C: Predator&ndash;Prey Dynamics </div>
                    
                    <p>As a third option for the project, you might choose to investigate the interactions between multiple species. Can you determine the populations of two competing species by using a deterministic or probabilistic model?  Just as in the other two options, you will be required to use real world data and realistic assumptions to model their interaction.</p>
                    
                    <div class="date">Groups</div> 
                    
                    <p>You will work in a group of at least two and at most three people.  It is important that you choose a group of people with whom you can <b>work</b> well.   You will have to meet outside class with your groupmates throughout the next few weeks.  Together you will come up with a project topic (vetted by Prof. Chris), determine the mathematical model you wish to study, collect relevant data, program a simulation in Python, and present your results to the class.</p>

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>You will build a simulation model based on a first-order system, using ideas that you have learned in Chapters 11&ndash;12 or 15&ndash;17 of the ModSimPy book.  You'll also keep working on crafting interesting and appropriate questions&mdash;those that can be answered with the tools you're learning and that are reasonable in scope&mdash;and interpreting the results of your model to answer those questions.</p>   
                        
                    <p>Your project will also be a first-order model, probably in the domain of either epidemiology or thermodynamics (but possibly in other domains). You will begin by considering one of the models presented in the book and then you will expand on it to answer a question. Here are three possible themes to consider:</p>

                    <div class="date">Option A: Epidemiology </div>
                    
                    <p>The first option is to begin with the SIR model in the book and find an interesting way to extend it. You will identify one or more (closely related) questions you can answer with your new model.</p>


                    <div class="date">Option B: Thermodynamics </div>
                    
                    <p>The second option is to begin with the coffee cooling model in the book and find an interesting way to extend it. You will identify one or more (closely related) questions you can answer with your new model. You might also find ways to collect data from a real-world situation, but if you want to do this, you should talk with an instructor about what you plan to do and how it relates to your model.
                    </p>
            
                    <div class="date">Option C: Other First-Order Systems </div>
                 
                    <p>The third option is to investigate some other first-order system, such as the pharmacokinetic model described in Chapter 17.  Please note that if you choose this option, you will  need to do some additional research.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li><em>Introduction.</em> This should provide the reader with the necessary background information about why your project is an interesting and worthwhile project, and where the project fits into real life.  <strong>Explicitly state the question you are investigating.</strong></li>
                <li><em>Methodology.</em> Explain in depth the mathematical model you are using to solve the problem.  Explicitly state any assumptions that you are making in your research.  Discuss how you worked to make your model as representative of real life as possible.  Describe how you modified the simulation from class to address your question.  If you collected data, explain how you collected data and why you collected data in that way.  If you obtained data from elsewhere, explain where your data came from and how reliable it is.
                </li>
                <li><em>Results.</em>  Explain the results of the simulation.  Include a few plots that highlight the message readers should take away, and discuss what these plots mean.  Your project should include a parameter sweep; include a plot of this information.  Discuss what the simulations say and what conclusions you can draw in terms of the real-life problem.</li>
                <li><em>Analysis.</em> Every model makes simplifying assumptions.  You need to elaborate on yours and explain what is good and what is bad about your model. Is your model accurate?  How do the results match with your expectations?  What future research should be undertaken?</li>
