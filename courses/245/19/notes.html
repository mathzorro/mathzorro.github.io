<div class="date">Wednesday, September 4</div> 
<div class="defn">Before class:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have access to a copy of Python and the course content <b>outside of class</b>, by either installing it on your own machine or using Azure Notebooks on a campus machine.  (<a href="software.html">Detailed instructions here</a>)</li>
    <li>Acquire a ≈80 page notebook to serve as your "Homework Notebook".</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Put your name and contact information in the notebook so you'll be able to get it back.</li>
            <li>Set aside the first five pages of the notebook.  Label this section "Objects" for building a list of objects that we'll be using in this class.</li>
            <li>Set aside the next five pages of the notebook.  Label this section "Syntax" for building a list of functions that we'll be using in this class.</li>
            <li>Your notes and other homework answers start afterward.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Thoroughly read all of the course webpage. </li>
    <li>Go to <a href="http://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a>.  (Reminder: You must be <a href="http://gdrive.qc.cuny.edu/">logged in through your QC account</a> and NOT be on your personal Gmail account!) Complete the following two tasks:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the <b>First Day Survey</b>, so I can learn about everyone's background and experience. </li>
            <li>Take the <b>Syllabus Quiz</b>.  Feel free to refer back to the course webpage to search for more in form.  <b>Retake the quiz as many times as necessary</b> to earn a score of 100%.  This will count toward your participation grade.</li>

    <li><a href="https://doodle.com/poll/azxwx73hmbcbguaz">Fill out this Doodle</a> to let me know when you are available for office hours this semester.  (Pretend like it is a normal week with no holidays --- select the times when you would be able to come to office hours regularly.)  I will try to choose times that work for most people.</li>
    <li>Read Chapter 0, Section 1.0 (pages 1&ndash;3), and Sections 2.1&ndash;2.5 (pages 7&ndash;14) of <a href="http://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/">Modeling and Simulation in Python</a>.  We will be starting with Chapter 2 in class Wednesday.  It is OK if you do not understand everything.  You are priming your brain for our in-class discussion.  You may wish to write yourself some notes about questions that come up or concepts that you'd like to discuss in class.</li>
    <li><b>Homework Questions:</b> Complete the following homework questions in your homework notebook (working after the objects and syntax sections) and be prepared to discuss them in class.  Work in your homework notebook.</li>

        <li><b>1-2.</b> In the introduction to Chapter 1, the author explains a quality of a model that might be desirable. Copy down the paragraph that starts "But often ". </li>
        <li><b>1-3.</b> How do we read the variables inside a <span style="font-family: monospace">State</span> object? </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Coding</b> (Give your brain and hands some practice.)

        <li><b>1-5.</b> What is the name of the package that allows us to work with units in python? (See page xii.) What is the line of code that imports this package into our notebooks? (See the <a href="software.html">course software page</a>.)</li>

Each time <span style="font-family: monospace">flip()</span> is called, it should print out whether the flip was a heads or a tail. When all the flips are done, it should print out the number of heads and tails that were seen. Check that your code also works when you increase the number of flips from 10 to something larger.</li>
        <li><b>4-7.</b> Create a new function called <span style="font-family: monospace">flip_count</span> that takes n and p as parameters, where n is the number of times to flip and p is the probability of coin flip falling heads.  It should output the number of heads and tails that are seen.  Run the function a couple of times with different parameters to make sure it works how you would expect. </li>

        <li><b>10-1.</b> For what real-world reasons might we like to know the largest value of (one or more of) S, I, or R and when it might happen?  </li>
        <li><b>10-2.</b> What does the book say that "hand washing" does to the model?  And why should that be the case?</li>
        <li><b>10-3.</b> If you change the time between contacts, how should that impact how many people will be infected and the dynamics of the number of people infected over time?  Similarly, if you change the recovery time, how should that impact how many people will be infected and the dynamics of the number of people infected over time?</li>

    <b>Coding</b>

        <li><b>10-4.</b>  Modify the tc and tr numbers in the Chapter 11 Python Notebook, re-run the simulation, and determine how many people are infected as those numbers change.  See if the final result matches the expectations you gave in your answer to Question 10-3.</li>
        <li><b>10-5.</b> There are three metrics given in the Exercise in the Metric section of the Chapter 12 python notebook. Create functions that implement <b>each of these three metrics</b>, just as we have created a <span style="font-family: monospace">calc_total_infected</span> function that computes the metric of the number of total people who were infected during the simulation by taking as an input the <span style="font-family: monospace">TimeFrame</span> named <span style="font-family: monospace">results</span>. </li>
