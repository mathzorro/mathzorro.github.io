                    <blockquote>
                    <p>Mathematical Modeling is a unique math class since its goal is to give you the tools necessary to use mathematics outside of school.  The language of mathematical modeling is the language that real-world companies and business managers understand.  If you are trying to convince your boss that she or he should follow a course of action that you suggest, you will need to justify yourself; basing your reasoning on a mathematically-sound model can provide the basis of your justification. </p>
                    
                    <p>In this class, you will be creating three mathematical models based on the material that we learn throughout the semester.  I would like to extend a large thank you to Allen Downey at Olin College who has been extremely generous in providing materials from when he taught this class.</p>

<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>You will be creating and analyzing a bikeshare model that builds on the bikeshare model from Chapters 2&ndash;4 of the ModSimPy book as your starting point.  Your goal will be to determine a precise problem statement, develop the methodology to investigate this problem statement,  run a simulation that implements the methodology, and interpret the results of this simulation.</p>

                    <div class="date">Groups</div> 
                    
                    <p>You will work in a group of at least two and at most three people.  It is important that you choose a group of people with whom you can <b>work</b> well.   You will have to meet outside class with your groupmates.</p>

                    <div class="date">Topics</div> 

                    <p>Here is a list of vague ways in which one might modify the bikeshare model.</p>  
                        
                    <ul>
                        <li>More than two locations</li>
                        <li>The number of bikes changes over time</li>
                        <li>The probabilities change over time</li>
                        <li>Competition comes in</li>
                        <li>Money gets involved</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        As a group, choose one of these areas and decide upon a precise problem statement that you will investigate.  (Other topics are also allowed; check with Prof. Chris first.)  As you choose your topic, consider the ways in which you will need to modify your simulation.
                    </p>
                        

                    <div class="date">Timeline</div>
            
                    <ul>                        
                        <li><strong>Project Proposal due Friday, September 13:</strong> 
                            <p>
                                Decide who you want to work with on your project and come up with a precise problem statement and a plan for modifying your simulation. Send an email to Prof. Chris with this information; he will give feedback so that you can revise the proposal by Monday, September 16, if necessary.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Work in your group to simulate the modified bikeshare model.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                By this date, you are expected to be have completed the final draft of your project.  On this day, we will spend time doing peer review, sharing your project with the other group at your table and discussing ways to improve it.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <li>Transition into a discussion of how you created a simulation to answer your problem statement.  You should explain how this model is different from the classic bikeshare model (from class).

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>You will be creating and analyzing a population dynamics model, using Chapters 5&ndash;8 of the ModSimPy book as your starting point.  The book analyzes various models based on explicit assumptions that have a basis in the real world.  Your project will also relate to population dynamics and be based in real world assumptions.  Here are some possible themes to consider:</p>

                    <div class="date">Option A: Human or Animal Population Models </div>
                    
                    <p>The first option is to ask and answer an interesting question about a human population or an animal population on Earth by extending the model developed in class. You will collect data online relevant to the questions you want to answer.</p>

            
                    <div class="date">Option B: Stochastic Population Models </div>
                    
                    <p>For this option, you can try to simulate a human or animal population's growth over time using random processes, similar to how we used randomness in the Bike Share model.   Instead of a deterministic growth rate, consider a model in which the growth rate for each time period is drawn at random from a probability distribution (which might in turn be estimated from empirical data). One question that a stochastic population model might address is the likelihood of a population dying out. You will find that there is a wealth of information (including time-series data) available for many different species in many areas of the world.

                    <p>As a third option for the project, you might choose to investigate the interactions between multiple species. Can you determine the populations of two competing species by using a deterministic or probabilistic model?  Just as in the other two options, you will be required to use real world data and realistic assumptions to model their interaction.</p>
                    
                    <div class="date">Groups</div> 
                    
                    <p>You will work in a group of at least two and at most three people.  It is important that you choose a group of people with whom you can <b>work</b> well.   You will have to meet outside class with your groupmates throughout the next few weeks.  Together you will come up with a project topic (vetted by Prof. Chris), determine the mathematical model you wish to study, collect relevant data, program a simulation in Python, and present your results to the class.</p>

                    <p>The final deliverables of this project will be a (group) quad chart, a (group) five-minute presentation, and an (individual) group dynamics paragraph.</p>  
                    
                    <p><span style="color:#609"><b>The quad chart must:</b></span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Have a descriptive and meaningful title.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Adhere to the correct format.</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use four 8.5" &times; 11" sheets of paper.</li>
                            <li>Each sheet should be in landscape format with at least 0.5" margin around.</li>   
                            <li>The fonts should be no smaller than 24pt. </li>
                            <li>Each sheet must be headed either "Objective", "Methodology", "Results", or "Conclusions".</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <li><b>Include an Objective Section.</b></li>
                        <p>Here you introduce the primary and secondary problem statements, highlighting the population being modeled, who cares about the problem, and setting the stage for the type of answer you are looking for.</p>
                        
                        <li><b>Include an Methodology Section.</b></li>
                        <p>Here you include the main assumptions you made, why you made those assumptions, the way you decided to model the  growth function, where you got your data, and the types of simulation you used, relating it back to the objective. </p>
                        
                        <li><b>Include an Results Section.</b></li>
                        <p>Here you include chart(s) that show your most important results, with labeled axes, and a description of what the viewer is supposed to be getting out of your figure. You also need to explain how you validated or verified your results (variable sweeping perhaps?) Interpret your results as an answer to your question.</p>
                        
                        <li><b>Include an Conclusions Section.</b></li> 
                        <p>  What does the model you created say?  What are the limitations of your model?  Are the assumptions realistic?  Be honest and critical of your work.  It is OK if you say your model didn't work.  Show that you know it doesn't work and explain why.</p>
                                            
                        <li><b>Be formatted in a clear and organized manner.</b> 
                            <p>Spend time organizing your text and images.  Your quad chart should not be only text.  Work to make your final layout visually appealing.</p> </li>

                            <p>Introduce yourselves, your topic, and explain who is the audience of your presentation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Discuss each of the sections in the quad chart.</b>
                        <p>Spend time making sure that the class learns about your objective, methodology, results, and conclusions.</p>

                        </li>
                        <p>Use it as such.  Do not read from your chart. </p>

                        </li>
                        <p>Make sure each person speaks for at least two minutes (for a group with two members) or at least one minute (for a group with three members).</p>

                        <li><b>Be organized and rehearsed.</b>  
                            <p>You need to make sure that you have practiced what you are going to say a couple of times.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Respect the time limit.</b>  
                            <p>Five minutes is a very short amount of time!  This means you really need to have practiced multiple times so that you use your time efficiently.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <span style="color:#609"><b>For the group dynamics paragraph:</b></span>
                    <p>Write a paragraph that includes your impression of the contributions of the group members.  Do you feel like each group member participated equally?  Did each member contribute to the project throughout the process, including forming the project topic, developing the project methodology, planning and running the python simulations and results, analyzing the model, compiling the quad sheet, and preparing for the presentation?

                    <div class="date">Overview</div>

                    <p>You will build a simulation that models the interaction between multiple populations / quantities based on a system of first-order differential equations, using ideas that you have learned in Chapters 11&ndash;17 of the ModSimPy book.  You'll also keep working on crafting interesting and appropriate questions&mdash;those that can be answered with the tools you're learning and that are reasonable in scope&mdash;and interpreting the results of your model to answer those questions.</p>   
                        
                    <p>You will expand upon the basic models to answer a question of your choosing. Here are three possible themes to consider:</p>

                    <div class="date">Option A: Epidemiology </div>
                    
                    <p>The first option is to begin with the SIR model in the book and find an interesting way to extend it. You will identify one or more (closely related) questions you can answer with your new model.</p>

                    <div class="date">Option B: Pharmacokinetics </div>
                    
                    <p>The second option is to begin with the pharmacokinetics model in the book and find an interesting way to extend it. You will identify one or more (closely related) questions you can answer with your new model.
                    </p>
            
                    <div class="date">Option C: Product Adoption </div>
                    
                    <p>The third option is to explore the ways in which products or ideas are adopted, similar to what is discussed on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics">System Dynamics</a>. You will identify one or more (closely related) questions you can answer with your new model.
                    </p>
        
                    <div class="date">Option D: Other First-Order Systems </div>
                 
                    <p>The third option is to investigate some other system in which multiple populations or quantities interact by way of differential equations. This option will necessitate some additional research.
