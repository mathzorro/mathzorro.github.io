        <li><b>4-3.</b> Write down the fundamental steps of incremental development.</li>
        <li><b>4-4.</b> What is the difference between the the two functions <span style="font-family: monospace">bike_to_wellesley()</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">bike_to_wellesley(state)</span>?  Write a paragraph that gives one or more reasons why the first would be better than the second and one or more reasons why the second would be better than the first.</li>
        <li><b>4-5.</b> Write down the definition of a metric.  Write a sentence that explains what a metric is in your own words.  Give an example of a metric that you interact with in daily life.</li>

    <b>Coding</b>
    <ul>

        <li><b>4-6.</b> Copy the code from Question 3-8 into a new cell.  Modify the code by adding in <span style="font-family: monospace">print</span> commands that do the following.  Each time <span style="font-family: monospace">flip()</span> is called, it should print out whether the flip was a heads or a tail. When all the flips are done, it should print out the number of heads and tails that were seen. Check that your code also works when you increase the number of flips from 10 to something larger.  In your class notebook, copy down this information for a couple of trials.</li>

<div class="notes_section">Joining Discord:</div>

                    <div class="date">Step 1: Use the following invite link for a shortcut to the Discord Server.</div>
<ul>
<li>8:35 class: https://discord.gg/DH4FUQz</li>
<li>10:45 class: https://discord.gg/YTn29zH</li>
</ul>

<div class="date">Step 2: Log in or create an account:</div>

If you already have a Discord account, log in - under the "Continue button" there is a link to log in with your existing account information.

<br><br>If you don't have a Discord account, you're going to create one:
<ul>
<li>Type in the username that you will want to use on Discord.  (This has to be relatively unique in the system so they might say you have to choose a different name.)</li>
<li>You may have to verify that you are not a robot.</li>
<li>It asks you to claim your account.  Enter your email address and a password to create your account.</li>
</ul>

<div class="date">Step 3: Join our room and let us know who you are.</div> 

On the right panel your username appears to let people know who is in the discussion room.  Right click your username and select "Change Nickname".  Type in your actual name and this will update the room with your real name.  

<br><br>If you're having trouble with this step, just type in your real name at the bottom of the screen and I'm able to change your user name to your real name for you.

                    <div class="date">Step 4: Add me as your friend.</div>

You've joined our Discord Server and now we're going to set up our group chat rooms where we can do video chats with each other.  

<ul>
<li>4A: On the upper left hand side of the screen is the little joystick icon - click on it to go to your message list. </li>
<li>4B: Add "chanusa#9967" as a friend.  If this is your first time with an account, this should be the only option.  Type in chanusa#9967 and click "Send Friend Request".</li>
<li>4C: I will accept your friend request and create a group chat with the people in each project group.  (In order for me to do this, I need to be online and each group member has to join discord.)  This group chat will appear in the list of "Direct Messages" on this screen.</li>
