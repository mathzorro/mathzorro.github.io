                        <p>Dear Future Math 245 Student,

	Let me begin by saying, you will love this class. You may not be very fond of computer science but you will enjoy this class. Do not worry if your computer skills are not up to par, this course is coding beginner friendly. You will enjoy this class because you will be able to model real life issues through computer simulations. This could be anything from determining how much money should be spent on immunization marketing for illness prevention, to saving beehives, or even keeping your protein shake cool for a workout. Once you learn the basics, the choices are endless. This class will allow you to explore topics you are genuinely interested in and let your creativity flow.
	One thing I wish I knew at the beginning of this course is that practice is extremely important. You will not learn how to code by simply reading the textbook. You must be willing to test out the methods in the notebook and see what actually works. To make the most out of this class it requires, practice, practice, and more practice. Also take advantage of office hours and google classroom. The professor is here to help you with any questions you may have and trust me, someone else in the class has the same question you do. There are no stupid questions in this class, be open to help from your professor and other classmates.
	If you are a math major, like myself, you are probably are obsessed with getting things right. In this course, it is okay if your model does not do what you expect. It is also okay if the model does not work. Everything you do is a learning process and you should not see it as failure. It may take some time to get used to things not working, but keep pushing.
								Sincerely, Kayla
 P.S. never erase your code, it may just need a little fix.

                        <p>Future Math 245 students,
     Coming into this class, I expected to be learning how to create real-world models using typical formulas and properties used in math. For example, "How architects create abstract buildings using the properties of geometric shapes and slope formulas for the exteriors". Before this class started, Dr. Artzt told me about how students usually enjoyed the end of the year project. I am still unsure of what the students before me did in their Math 245 class, but I was under the impression that the end of the year project would be a physical model of each student's choice. I was surprised to find out that Math Modeling was about creating electronic simulations, not physical models.
     This semester, Math 245 was about learning how to use Python to create real-world simulations. In class, we learned about the real-world modeling process as well as how to code in Python to create basic simulations. Class time typically consisted of learning or reviewing Python using Azure notebooks. Projects were done in groups of 2-3 and consisted of creating a model as well as a presentation to help explain the important parts of your model to the class. After I dropped my assumptions for the class, I ended up enjoying it very much.</p>
                        
        <p>This is a very interactive class. You work in groups to approach questions in various ways. You should expect to learn how to address real world problems by properly posing questions, making assumptions, understanding key mathematical concepts, and turning ideas into code. You should expect to learn how to read and write basic code in python, and the various ways we model real-world problems in computer code. The class is engaging and very useful, especially if you plan working in mathematical fields. Keep up with the material as it is presented and stay up to date with the exercises. You should also expect to present your findings in a useful way. The key take away from this class is that this is a course on  understanding how to think of a model, create the model, and present the model's finding; not a course based on the fundamental understanding the mathematical concepts behind the models. 
From my own experience, I was not prepared to work in groups but it proved useful as it provided new ways to pose and address problems.  I was very familiar with the concepts of math that were utilized but they are only secondary to understanding how to create models of systems. I came in with no knowledge of how to code. This class more than adequately provided the tools and understanding necessary to be able to create your own code. I learned that coding is more flexible than it appears and it is the creative approach to solving problems that provides the rigidity that i came in expecting from this course. I also came in not expecting to present my findings but it proved valuable in learning to present key pieces of information and the important aspects behind the making of a model. The key component of our projects is understanding what makes some models better than others and how to critique our own models even after we get results.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dear
 Future Student,

If
 you’re in this class, it would be very beneficial if you have some background in coding. When I came into this class I didn’t know anything about coding, so it was difficult for me to understand it and get the hang of it. Don’t get me wrong though, I did enjoy
 it a lot. All the exercises and review of the readings we did in class were very useful in terms of understanding what the coding did and how it worked. Doing the readings and asking questions in class and on google classrooms was a great way to deepen your
 understanding of the models you work with. It’s not going to be easy, but constantly trying hard and seeing progress will be a great reward.

I learned a lot throughout the semester and it was nice to see
 how this class could be applied to the real world. While working through the 2 projects we had, I realized how important everything we do in class is. Of course, in the real word the coding and math behind these models are by far more complex, but to see how
 our models could be used is very eye opening. The projects were a lot of fun to do because I was able to work with any data I was interested in. Also, working in groups was fun and a great way to learn from one another. Overall, this class was one of the best
 classes I have taken and one that I’ll never forget.


</p>

                        <p>If I can help future student by telling them what to expect from this class, I would start with enthusiasm. I would let future students know that they should be ready to engage in projects that are thought provoking and require some critical thinking as to what ideas they wish to explore. They should be ready to see models displayed but learn how to think critically about modifying them depending on the project. 
They should also be ready to be self motivated. They can't expect that everything will be thought of for them they have to take ownership of the projects and really put some thought into the ideas they wish to explore. Overall they should expect to come to class and be a part of the learning experience rather than just memorizing what is taught. They should also be ready for a teacher who shows real enthusiasm and passion for the topic.</p>
                        <p>Dear Future Students of Math 245,
	You are now the world of math modeling. Be open minded, this subject is really cool. As someone who came in with barely any coding experience, I can tell you that this is possible. While it takes some getting used to, you will totally be able to realize your mistakes with some practice. Somethings I personally wished I knew before the beginning of this semester is what the course would entail. I had a different idea of what the content of the course would be, more thinking along the lines of making a model to represent a mathematical theorem. However, I was greatly surprised to find out we were going to use Python to make models by coding. 
	In this class, you should expect to learn coding and syntax. I recommend that you all make a glossary with the format of each kind of code. It helps a lot when you’re making your own models for the projects. Syntax gave me a lot of errors so be careful and be sure to read the textbook for help. Do the homework and all the self-assessments and you will never be behind. Most importantly, do not forget to ask questions! The more you participate the more things can be explained to you. Also, go to office hours because that’s where I think things really clicked for me.

Sincerely, 
Movina Seepersaud</p>
                        
                        <p>Dear future students of Math245,
Math modeling is like no other math class you have taken thus far. In math modeling you will be able to explore infinite methods to get to a desired conclusion or to establish your own methodology to support a prediction. This class entails coding. I entered math modeling with a weak background in coding. Here is a little tip about coding; press "SHIFT ENTER" to enter and run your code. Second tip, always make sure you "!pip install pint" before running your code if not you will get "ERROR". However, do not be concerned about your coding skills because the textbook presents the material in a clear way and the professor explains the chapter in depth during class. I highly suggest writing the significant codes down and describing their purpose. Additionally, during class you will be given the opportunity to work on the new code from each chapter. Be sure to ask a handful of questions because if you are stuck it is likely that your classmate might be facing similar issues.  
Math modeling entails a lot of creativity so be willing to step out of your comfort zone when conducting project ideas and objectives. Brainstorming and collaboration is key in math modeling because it allows you to work with real life situations that are intriguing such as monitoring diseases, bikeshares, and coffee cooling.  When coding you have freedom but utilize it wisely because at times there maybe alternatives that provide more accurate outcomes. Do not fear the words "INVALID SYNAX" you will be seeing that a lot but when you do make sure to go back into your code and debug.  Lastly, it is okay to make mistakes, but you must understand why the issue occurred and how it may be resolved in the future. Remember you model your own grade!

I wish you the best of luck in math modeling!

Best, 
Tatijana Lonic

                        <p>     First thing, Professor Hanusa does not give exams and final. However, some people decided to take advantage of that so that it may change for you guys. For us, the grade depends on the two projects and class participation. Professor Hanusa is very friendly, helpful, and can tell that he cares about the students. I feel he is one of the best professors that I have so far, not only because that he does not give exams but he is very approachable and willing to help you in your project in the last minutes (I did not ask for help, but I saw many of my classmates did it). If I am going to retake this class, I wish I will pay more attention to the lecture and participate more in the class.

         For the future students, I had few suggestions: First, try to learn python and don't give up so easily because it did not seem hard as it looks. Second, pay attention to the basic skills/codes in python, you will find it useful when you write your project. Third, do your homework/self-assessment, don't copy the work from your classmate because it will not help you in the future, especially it will be related to the future project. Finally, read the textbook before the class so you will understand the topic better.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dear Future Students,

	I came into this class being a perfectionist.  I used to get very discouraged when something did not go the way I expected it to.  In this class, we did a lot of projects.  For the first group, we choose our partners.  For the second group, our partners was chosen for us, but with our preference in consideration.   With these two projects, I believe I struggled a lot because I wanted our projects to work.  Again, I would get very discouraged when something does not go the way I expect it to; so when our models did not work, I felt very discouraged. However, Professor Hanusa constantly reassured the class that it is okay if the models did not work.  Not everything is going to work the way we want it to.  Everyone would always tell you it is okay to make mistakes, however, with me, even if I make a mistake, I feel bad.  In this class, if I make a mistake, I feel like the mistake was fine.  I did not feel dumb.
If anyone takes this class, I just want them to know that this class is all about progress.  It is okay to be mistakes as long as you are trying.  Professor Hanusa’s office is always open and is always, ALWAYS willing to help.  Although for the second project, our group was chosen and sometimes we may not get the people that we want, I believe Professor Hanusa paired up the groups really well.  For this class, ask questions, participate, and just try.  This is the main thing I love about this class, as long as I try my best, I won’t fail. 

Best,
Grace Tan
</p>
                        
                        <p>Dear Future Students, 

Welcome to MATH 245! Although Math Modeling sounds like a class where you will make physical models, it is actually about coding and making a mathematical model on the computer, using Python. Therefore, you want to enter this class with sufficient knowledge of coding, it will be very helpful. I wish I knew coding before entering this class. Although, if you do not know how to code so well, do not worry so much. Professor Chris is very helpful when explaining code and syntax. 

In this class, you should expect to work well with others and work well with your professor. Also, do not be afraid to ask questions - questions are essential and helpful. You will have two interesting projects during the semester. First project will include population prediction of species and the second project will include coffee cooling or an SIR model. I know that might sound foreign to you, but they are both very fun and interesting to do. Get ready to make fun codes and work in a learning experience environment. Have fun and enjoy. 


From, 

Erika Mojocoa 


P.S. - Do not forget to do the homework on google classroom. </p>
                        
                        
<p>To start off with, Math Modeling is a very interesting class. We get to see how diseases, populations and other life activities can be coded in Python. At the beginning of the semester I wish I would have known that it was going to be mostly coding. I thought the class was going to be more of a lecture where we learn about math applications in the real world. I did not expect to be learning about Python and actually modeling real life situations in a computer program.

To be honest, this class is difficult if you are not very good at coding. Expect to read a lot of pages in the textbook to better your understanding of coding. Be sure to ask questions in the daily question; this will help Professor Hanusa know what your problems are and what he needs to go over I class to help you better understand. Also, take advantage of Professor Hanusa’s office hours. He is very helpful with the projects that we have to complete for his class (also his office is very cool!).

Good luck in your semester and in his class!

Nicole M.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dear future students,

	My name is Tony Yung, a student at Queens College. I’d like to tell you about my experience regarding Math 245: Mathematical Models. I came in this class not knowing anything at all. I expected to learn different styles of math modeling, just as the class stated. However, I was not informed that I was going to use a coding language to do just that. I wish I had known from the beginning that I was going to use a coding language to learn so I could have prepared in advance and be ready. It was my first semester learning a coding language, so it was very enticing for me. When the breakdown of the class came, I didn’t know there was going to be only 2 projects for the class, which were both worth 40% of my grade. I was shocked but a bit eager to do my best. For the coming class, students should expect a lot of time practicing on coding and how much time it really takes to learn it. Furthermore, students should expect to work in groups and should try to make acquaintances and possibly friends, for the projects. 
I believe students can enjoy the class if they’re interested in learning how to code for the first time or have a basic understanding of it. I would also like to say that anyone who likes statistics may find this class interesting. The projects are very fun if students have good group members and interesting topics they may want to work on. However, they must be prepared for all the time it takes to learn it. It wasn’t easy for me, since it was my first time ever learning code. Nevertheless, it is still an interesting method to model real-life math situations. My advice is to try to KNOW what coding is and try it out before taking the class, so you have a basic foundation before going in blindly. Hopefully, you may like the class when you take it.

Sincerely,

Tony Yung
</p>
                        
                        <p>Based on my experience in this course, I have two recommendations. There are more recommendations. But I believe these two are the most important. One is participation in class. Second is office hour. These two recommendation will help you succeed in the course.
Let me explain why I believe participation. It is part of our grade. But this is not my point. What I want to said is to make sure you understand the material in class. Professor Chris always go over the coding in class before we do our projects. If you do not understand the material you should ask question in class. If not you will end up doing your own research in by yourself. It is much easier if you ask for clarification in class. So make sure you understand material before you leave the classroom.
Second use the office hour wisely. When you are doing the project you will approach some difficulties such as coding. You can overcome them by yourself. But I guarantee you will be very frustrated and tire in the process. And it is time consuming. When you face this situation, rather than overcome them by yourself, you should ask for help. Professor Chris is willing to help his students with any problem. I remember he adjusted the office for us. You should take advantage of the office hour. It safe you times and no more frustration. 
</p>
                        
                        <p>I thought it was strange, and impossible, on the first day of class, when Professor Chris told us that we would learn to see basically any life situation in a mathematical way. Well, he was right.</p>
<p>This course has been very challenging for me. The homeworks are very long; it usually took me many hours to complete them. I had to learn a new language, Mathematica, on the computer. I remember thinking that I would not survive the course. </p>
<p>Well, I did survive it, and I'm very glad that I did. Professor Chris's course has opened up my eyes to a whole world of math. Math really is everywhere, though I wouldn't have known that if it weren't for Math 245 (math modeling). I worked in a study group throughout the semester with my two friends, and that helped a lot. I didn't realize it at the time, but as the semester went on I became more used to the course, and it became a little easier. Now, I see how the course really helps in every day life. As a math student, we are encouraged to see math and its applications in our everyday lives. I now cannot leave math alone--I sit in the waiting room at the doctor's office and write out Mathematica loops in my head, which can model the situation in the waiting room. It sounds insane, but it really is awesome. </p>
<p>My advice to you, a future student: realize all that this course has to offer and do not give up. Work hard because it is worth it. Pick a project topic you are sincerely interested in. Complete the Mathematica tutorials. Go to Prof. Chris early on if you need help. Do not give up. You can do it, and you should! </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="course_letter">  
                        <p>At the beginning of the semester, you might be confused about how one topic relates to the next, and this is understandable.  This is because you are learning topics which are the tools for mathematical modeling.</p> 
<p>The goal of this class is to teach you how to build a model on your own, so you will be assigned a group project to complete. In completing the group project is when you will use all the modeling knowledge you learned during the semester. It is as if you have wood, nails, a hammer, and paint without knowing that you will be building a table. The only thing you need to do is to learn how to use them. The materials in this example are the different topics in the lessons, and the wooden table is your mathematical model. Before you start to build your table, you need to learn how to use the tools. The same is true in mathematical modeling.</p> 
<p>I hope that you will learn a lot in professor Hanusa's class.  Have a great semester.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="course_letter">  
                        <p>This class is not a hard class but requires a lot of thinking.  Most math classes you can jump right in and start doing a problem, while this class is different.  Before you start doing any problem you will first need to think about what the question is asking you and how you are going to answer the question.  Then you can start actually doing the question and once you are done and have completed the question Professor Hanusa asks you to write out in words what you have done.  That the reason why the homework can sometimes take so long.</p>

        <p>While doing the homework make sure you are thorough.  At the time writing out everything in words can be very annoying but once it comes on the test, it will be very helpful.  Sometimes in other classes you look back at your notes and homework assignments and you do not remember why you did something.  But when you have the words written out it makes it a lot easier to study from.</p>

        <p>When it comes the notes in class, Professor Hanusa will give you power point slides.  But the slides are not necessarily sufficient; you should also be paying attention in class and taking notes onto the slides.  There are things that Professor Hanusa will say but aren’t on the slides.  You should also write down the examples that he does in class because they will be helpful when are trying to study.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="course_letter">  
                        <p>This class was different from any other math class you have ever taken because it teaches you the math you already know and REALLY connects them to the real world. It breaks the mold of the typical real world connection (such as "hair grows at an exponential rate.") It helps to explain the other factors that our teachers usually brushed of with the excuse "that is beyond the scope of this course." This gives you the power to include the things you really want to study and ignore the things you don't as long as it is backed by logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Though this class will require a lot of time devoted to homework, studying, and the main mathematical modeling project, looking back will reveal a picture that over the course of time the class has painted. As long as you do your homework, come prepared to class, study for tests and prepare the mathematical modeling project well, this class will pay off in the end. This class is like a blender, during the class your mind is constantly turning but when the blender is off, you realize that something else was created.</p>

                        <p>Dear Future Mathematical Modeling Student,</p>

        <p>Hi.  You’re probably sitting in your chair and wondering what to expect from this class.  If you’re like me, you probably signed up for this class because you need math credits and it was one of the only courses with seats still open.  In that case you just know you need to do well no matter what the course entails.  Or maybe you picked the class because the two sentences describing it on the Queens College registration website piqued your interest.  Maybe it just fit in well with the rest of your schedule.  In any case, here’s what you need to know about succeeding in Professor Hanusa’s Mathematical Modeling course.</p>

        <p>The first thing you need to know is that there is a lot of writing involved, much more so than you’ve probably ever had to do for another math class.  And I’m not talking about writing numbers, equations, and formulas, though that is part of it.  In addition to those, for your homework assignments you will be writing very detailed explanations about concepts learned in class and explanations about how you used them.  You need to brush up on your sentence structuring and grammar to make sure you can accurately convey the points you’ll be trying to make.  If a homework problem does involve numbers and formulas, in addition to actually solving the equation you’ll need to explain your methodology and why you set things up the way you did to solve the problem.</p>

       <p> All of the notes will be posted online on the course website.  Actually, pretty much everything you need to know about the course, from the general syllabus to homework assignments to due dates, will be on the site.  It’s an extremely helpful resource.  Use it well.  Professor Hanusa posts the notes online before the class he uses them in but I recommend bringing a notebook and writing the notes every day, using the online notes as a backup only.  From a personal standpoint, I find it easier to understand things and remember them later when I write them myself.  Sometimes there are typos too, so it’s easier to just write things correctly instead of trying to remember what in the online notes needed correcting.</p>

        <p>You will also use Mathematica, a very powerful mathematical software program.  This will be essential to your studies, as the professor uses it A LOT in the notes and homework assignments.  If you have ever taken a computer programming course you will know what to expect from Mathematica, as it’s very similar to Java and C++ in certain respects.  If you’ve never taken a programming course I will tell you now, prepare to feel in over your head.  When you’re asked to modify code or write your own it gets very complicated very quickly, especially if you have a full course load and don’t have time to devote to mastering the nuances of the programming language.</p>

        <p>There’s also a very large project due towards the end of the year.  The first time you see it, it will appear daunting, and it does not get talked about in class until after the first midterm.  DO NOT PANIC!  You will learn about the concepts that you will apply for the project during the semester, so talking about it any earlier will only confuse you.  My advice would be that as the first half of the semester progresses, start giving some thought as to what experiments you could focus your project on that would use concepts that get introduced.  Also, I wouldn’t recommend doing the project with more than one other person.  You’re allowed to team up with up to four people, but I have always found that it’s easier to make sure everyone contributes evenly the fewer people you have.  Do not go this one alone.</p>

        <p>In summary, prepare to spend a lot more time on this class than you thought you would.  It’s a very interesting class, but you need to make a significant investment to get the most out of it.  Time management will be key, especially if you have other writing intensive courses and no freedom to shift your schedule around, like I did.  If I can get through this class, then so can you. Good luck!</p>

                        <p>To future students,</p>
        <p>Starting out in this class in the beginning of the year, I did not know what to expect. Based on the title of the class I thought it would all be about data collecting, and then plotting that said data. I soon found out how wrong I was. Mathematical modeling was a class where we learnt to question what we saw on paper. If we were presented with information or data we were taught methods to ascertain the certainty of the data. We learned how to look at raw data and fit it to specific functions thus seeing accurate trends in the data. Something that I wish I had known before I took the class is what the so called "project" actually entailed. I had heard of rumors flying around about it and I wish I knew what it was before I signed up. The project gave the students an opportunity to see the modeling process firsthand, and to delve into all its intricacies, and see how rewarding it can be in the end. All in all I would definitely recommend for anyone interested in quantitative data and analyzing information to take this course, because I got a lot out of it.</p>
