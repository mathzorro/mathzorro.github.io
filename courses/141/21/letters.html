<p>Dear future calculus 141 student,</p>
            <p>Hi! I hope the start of the semester is going smoothly and you are taking all the classes you wanted. I am currently enrolled in Calculus 141 and it is almost the end of the semester. We had our last class today and now all that is left is the final exam which will take place in several days. I wish someone wrote me a letter when I was entering the course because there were some things as a freshman, I was uninformed about. Whether or not you are a freshman though, this advice can still be beneficial.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, I suggest you review pre-calculus before the semester so you are not rusty in your math skills. This class requires you to know all formulas learned in previous math courses such as volume and areas of shapes, so look over those as well. Secondly, it is crucial to know about the Math Lab, a room full of free math tutors in Kiely Hall 331. It is an amazing place where I spend multiple hours every week doing homework and brushing up on concepts I am not yet confident in. Also, I advise you to take homework seriously, practice really does make perfect and if you work with a buddy, even better.</p> 
                        <p>I’m not going to lie to you, the start of the term was very hard for me and I didn't do so well on the first test. However, afterward my attitude changed. I started putting more effort into the class and I have noticed my own math skills improving greatly over the course of this fall semester. I hope you go in with the right mindset and motivation to succeed. Have fun in calculus, it is really cool and you will be very proud of yourself for what you are capable of accomplishing. I know you will be really great! “Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.”(Helen Keller)</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
                        <p>Calculus student</p>

                        <p>                    Dear Calculus 141 students:</p>
 
<p>     If you are anything like me, Calculus is the furthest you have gone in your math academic careers and you have most likely put it off, until now.  In the beginning of the semester, I felt confident, having taken Pre-calculus, I was prepared for the course.  I might have “overestimated” (remember this term when you reach linearalizations) my readiness.  As expected, Calculus relies on all of your previous knowledge and sometimes, plain old common sense.  Algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and even drawing skills, come back to pay you a visit.</p>
<p>     My advice to do well in the course is to first make sure you review all your trig functions, your area and volume formulas.  This will save you time when trying to solve problems.  Most importantly, while going through the semester, know your definitions inside and out.  I have to admit that in past courses I would look at a formula, memorize it, and simply plug in my numbers.  This method will not work here.  Understand what they actually mean, it sounds redundant, but take it seriously.  Know when they apply and all the special cases or exceptions to the rules.  Take advantage of learning from your peers, sometimes, they’re able to explain things differently.  Finally, practice, practice, practice, doing problems, especially, word problems.  I can’t emphasize that enough.  As I have learned, this is what Calculus ultimately boils down to; applying all of it to real life problems, minimizing costs or time, maximizing profit or distance, etc.  Now, take a deep breath, and good luck!</p>

<p> If you have a love for math and would enjoy a method of calculation, especially one of several highly systematic methods of treating problems by a special system of algebraic notations; then calculus, especially course number 141, is the class for you! After taking an Introduction to Calculus class in high school, and succeeding by obtaining high grades, I felt it would be awesome to take a similar calculus course upon my entry to Queens College. Thinking back to the beginning of the semester, it would have been nice to know that the amount of homework in this class would exceed my expectations. However, as I matured as a college freshman, I soon became accustomed to the high level of homework and actually found it to be quite beneficial. By completing homework, I felt it was great practice especially for tests.</p>
<p>        Be prepared to work hard and dedicate time to this class, especially if you’re the type of student who loves challenges. This means balancing your time well so that when the semester ends, as I came to find out, you can end the class with a high grade. So, be prepared to explore calculus like you would never have imagined before! From limits to derivatives, to differentials and unique mathematical theorems, you will experience the thorough definitions of each of those terms. Also, besides being a calculus class, Math 141 is also a social class. What I mean by this is, even if you are a typically quiet person you should take a class that allows you to “open up” by making new friends, working with others to solve math problems that, who knows, neither of you may be able to answer. This aspect of the class was especially an imperative one that Professor always wanted to convey to his students. I can proudly say that I am glad to have been a student of Professor Hanusa’s and to have had him as a Professor.</p>

<p>Salutations Incoming Students,</p>

<p>Upon entering this course, I was heavily intimidated by the weight of the word, "calculus" let alone an entire course on it! I took a seat in this very classroom, our class being gladly received by Professor Hanusa, we got a chance to exchange conversation with each other that first day and from day two, the road began.</p>

<p>I'd like to impart some tips or advice that I would have appreciated knowing for myself. It's essential to read the chapters for the lecture due that day. Math textbooks use words very precisely; each word is written with purpose. Truthfully, I underestimated the power of English in this class. Do, do the work required of you before class coming to class with questions and also a certain zeal for learning. Professor is very kind so meet with him during his hours! There is also tutoring is also offered Monday through Friday in Kiely 331. Tutoring is also offered in Delaney Hall, it's aimed for SEEK students, however, they help anyone and it's usually empty in there. I stress tutoring so much because it for me, became essential to my keeping up with homework. It's a great place to study math because at any point you're stuck, you have help available for you.</p>

<p>Calculus, from what I've gathered is having mastery over concepts (their definitions) and practicing them. Encountering a variety of questions, familiarizing yourself with the format, and gaining knowledge on how to tackle each one as it comes, it's all time consuming but well worth the effort. It's all sounds so simple everything I'm sharing now, but it took me an entire semester to figure it out. I wasted a lot of my time going about studying one way when the correct route had been the path opposite mine.</p>

<p>I wish you all much academic success,</p>
