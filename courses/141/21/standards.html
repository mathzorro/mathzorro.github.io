                    <p>As detailed on the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, your assessment grade in this course will be determined by your proficiency on a variety of standards. (This is known as Standards Based Grading.)</p>
                    <p>Here is the list of standards that form the basis for this class, along with guiding questions that address each standard.  You will be assessed on these standards throughout the semester. </p>
                    <p>What is different from the high-stakes "tests" that you might associate with a math class, there is an opportunity for you to re-assess your knowledge if you did not master the knowledge the first time around.</p>

<!--                    <p>The standards are categorized and color-coded based on what types of skill you are learning: 
                        <ul>
                            <li><span style="color: red"><b>Mathematical Maturity.</b> These standards are important ideas and concepts that help you to improve your learning of mathematical concepts.</span></li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px"><span style="color: saddlebrown"><b>Your Mathematical Toolbox.</b> These standards are basic skills upon which we build a deeper knowledge base.</span></li>
                            <li style="padding-top: 5px"><span style="color: rebeccapurple"><b>Key Concepts and Theory.</b> These standards represent the fundamental ideas that underlie this area of mathematics.</span></li>
