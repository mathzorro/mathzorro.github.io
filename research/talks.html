<!--Teaching Mathematical Art: Coordinating Design and 3D Printing
I teach Queens College MATH 213: Math with Mathematica as a student-driven project-based class. Our second project this Spring 2015 was to design and print a piece of three-dimensional mathematical art using Mathematica. We'll discuss the project with a focus on what worked, and present the fruits of the students' labor.
Course Materials and a Virtual Art Gallery are available online at http://qc.edu/~chanusa/courses/213/15/-->

                    <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> The iterative development process is a framework used to design products and applications across a wide range of domains. It centers around building prototypes, testing them, and updating based on the test results. We discuss how we applied this technique to create Fractal Emergence, an interactive piece of mathematical art.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> In this talk I discuss the project-based course "<a href="../courses/128/23/index.html">Mathematical Design</a>" that I developed at Queens College to give non-math students a glimpse into the beauty of mathematics. Students learn the mathematics of transformations of functions, polar equations, and parametric equations, as well as the elements of art and design. They use this knowledge to create artwork using the online graphing software Desmos and realize their artwork physically using AxiDraw Pen Plotters in the Queens College Makerspace. The final project asks students to branch out to realize their mathematical art on other machines in the Makerspace, including the 3D printer, the laser cutter, and the embroidery machine. Students get practice in design thinking and experience with productive failure. The culmination of the semester is an art exhibition that celebrates everyone's progress as a mathematician, an artist, and as a maker. I will share information about the course's implementation, best practices for student success, lessons learned, and plenty of pictures of student work.</p>

                <p><strong>Abstract: </strong> Join us and meet Christopher Hanusa, the artist behind Gallery 1064's newest art show <i>Existence and Uniqueness"</i> We will have a chat with the artist and discover the creation process behind the collection.</p>

                <p>In this body of work, the artist and mathematician focuses on the tension between randomness and deliberation. The art is crafted using mathematical functions injected with random elements, generating unique pieces of art at each iteration of the mathematical code written for that specific concept. The artist selects and curates these random works to capture the aesthetic and the essence that inspired a specific art.</p>

                <p>When a mathematician proves a theorem about having exactly one answer to a question of interest, they need to prove both the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Similarly, Christopher Hanusa plays with an experimental process to generate these artworks, that become, thanks to their own existence, proof of concept for the original idea being explored. They are a corporeal and tactile representation of mathematical beauty. By their own nature, they also embody uniqueness and remind us of the beauty and serendipity hidden in a sequence of random events.</p> 

                <p>Existence and Uniqueness blurs the boundaries between art and math, between the intangible and the corporeal, between impermanence and calculation. </p>

Its integrated approach to syntax means that its 3D printing capabilities can be applied far and wide.  In this talk, we’ll discuss the basics of working with this functional programming language, get our hands dirty with 3D coordinate systems, transformations, and randomness, and highlight multiple ways to create 3D models directly from the curated Wolfram ecosystem, including mathematics, chemistry, biology, and geography.</p>

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> My students use Mathematica to design 3D printed mathematical sculptures. But how to guide and assess their work? I will discuss the framework I provide that enables the students' creativity to shine through no matter what level of mathematical knowledge or programming experience they have. And I'll discuss the deliverables and grading scheme that I've developed to ensure that students' work is thoughtful, refined through a revision process, and is commensurate with their ability.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> For a fixed number of nonattacking queens placed on a square board of varying size, we show that the number of solutions is a quasipolynomial function of the size of the board using Ehrhart theory. This result generalizes to other real and fairy pieces on a polygonal board. Determining the period of each quasipolynomial function requires calculating the least common multiple of all subdeterminants of a matrix. This matrix has the form of a Kronecker product of a matrix involving the moves of the piece and the incidence matrix of a complete graph. Investigation of this quantity gives a new linear algebraic result proved using graph theory. No background knowledge is necessary to enjoy this talk.
