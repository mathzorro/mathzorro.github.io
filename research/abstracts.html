<blockquote>                                      
    <p>We show that the dual graph of the triangulation of the flow polytope of the zigzag graph adorned with the length-reverse-length framing is a subgraph of a grid graph. Through Mészáros, Morales, and Striker's bijection between simplices of the triangulation, integer flows of a different, supplemental flow polytope, we provide a simple numerical characterization of the adjacency between the triangulation's simplices in terms of their corresponding integer flows. The proofs result from the development of Postnikov and Stanley's sequences of noncrossing bipartite trees as combinatorial objects we call groves. We propose two new statistics derived from this construction that we conjecture recover the <i>h*</i>-polynomial of the flow polytope of the zigzag graph. </p>

    <p>We apply a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system originally considered by Arnol'd reminiscent of mathematical billiards to the study of two-move riders, a type of fairy chess piece.  In this model, particles travel through a bounded convex region along line segments of one of two fixed slopes.</p> 

    <p>We apply this dynamical system to characterize the vertices of the inside-out polytope arising from counting placements of nonattacking chess pieces and also to give a bound for the period of the counting quasipolynomial.

    <p>As a consequence, we give a simple proof that the period of the bishops' counting quasipolynomial is 2, and provide formulas bounding periods of counting quasipolynomials for many two-move riders including all partial nightriders.  We draw parallels to the theory of mathematical billiards and pose many new open questions.</p>

 <blockquote> 
     <p>Kostant’s partition function is a vector partition function that counts the number of ways one can express a weight of a Lie algebra g as a nonnegative integral linear combination of the positive roots of g. Multiplex juggling sequences are generalizations of juggling sequences that specify an initial and terminal configuration of balls and allow for multiple balls at any particular discrete height. Magic multiplex juggling sequences generalize further to include magic balls, which cancel with standard balls when they meet at the same height.</p>
                    
     <p>In this paper, we establish a combinatorial equivalence between positive roots of a Lie algebra and throws during a juggling sequence. This provides a juggling framework to calculate Kostant’s partition functions, and a partition function framework to compute the number of juggling sequences. From this equivalence we provide a broad range of consequences and applications connecting this work to polytopes, posets, positroids, and weight multiplicities.</p>

 <blockquote>
    <p>In 1997 Bousquet-M&eacute;lou and Eriksson introduced lecture hall partitions as the inversion vectors of elements of the parabolic quotient C&#771;/C.  We provide a new view of their correspondence that allows results in one domain to be translated into the other.  We determine the equivalence between combinatorial statistics in each domain and use this correspondence to translate certain generating function formulas on lecture hall partitions to new observations about C&#771;/C.</p>

    <p>An <i>(a,b)</i>-Dyck path <i>P</i> is a lattice path from <i>(0,0)</i> to <i>(b,a)</i> that stays above the line <i>y=ax/b</i>. The zeta map is a curious rule that maps the set of <i>(a,b)</i>-Dyck paths onto itself; it is conjecturally bijective, and we provide progress towards proof of bijectivity in this paper, by showing that knowing <i>ζ(P)</i> and <i>ζ(P<sup>c</sup>)</i> is enough to recover <i>P</i>.</p> 

    <p>Our method begets an area-preserving involution <i>χ</i> on the set of <i>(a,b)</i>-Dyck paths when <i>ζ</i> is a bijection, as well as a new method for calculating <i>ζ<sup>-1</sup></i> on classical Dyck paths. For certain nice <i>(a,b)</i>-Dyck paths we give an explicit formula for <i>ζ<sup>-1</sup></i> and <i>χ</i> and for additional <i>(a,b)</i>-Dyck paths we discuss how to compute <i>ζ<sup>-1</sup></i> and <i>χ</i> inductively. </p>

    <p>We also explore Armstrong's skew length statistic and present two new combinatorial methods for calculating the zeta map involving lasers and interval intersections. We provide a combinatorial statistic <i>δ</i> that can be used to recursively compute <i>ζ<sup>-1</sup></i>, and show that <i>δ</i> is computable from <i>ζ(P)</i> in the Fuss-Catalan case.</p>

Part I showed that the number of ways to place <i>q</i> identical nonattacking pieces is given by a quasipolynomial function of <i>n</i> of degree <i>2q</i>, whose coefficients are (essentially) polynomials in <i>q</i> that depend cyclically on <i>n</i>.

The coefficients of the three highest powers of <i>n</i> do not vary with <i>n</i>.  On the other hand, we present simple pieces for which the fourth coefficient varies periodically.

<blockquote>
    <p>By means of the Ehrhart theory of inside-out polytopes we establish a general counting theory for nonattacking placements of chess pieces with unbounded straight-line moves, such as the queen, on a polygonal convex board.  The number of ways to place <i>q</i> identical nonattacking pieces on a board of variable size <i>n</i> but fixed shape is given by a quasipolynomial function of <i>n</i>, of degree <i>2q</i>, whose coefficients are polynomials in <i>q</i>.  
The number of combinatorially distinct types of nonattacking configuration is the evaluation of our quasipolynomial at <i>n=-1</i>.  
The quasipolynomial has an exact formula that depends on a matroid of weighted graphs, which is in turn determined by incidence properties of lines in the real affine plane.  
We study the highest-degree coefficients and also the period of the quasipolynomial, which is needed if the quasipolynomial is to be interpolated from data, and which is bounded by some function, not well understood, of the board and the piece's move directions.</p>

<p>In subsequent parts we specialize to the square board and then to subsets of the queen's moves, and we prove exact formulas (most but not all already known empirically) for small numbers of queens, bishops, and nightriders. </p>

    <p>An <em>n</em>-core partition is an integer partition whose Young diagram contains no hook lengths equal to <em>n</em>.  We consider partitions that are simultaneously <em>a</em>-core and <em>b</em>-core for two relatively prime integers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, which correspond to abacus diagrams and the combinatorics of the affine symmetric group (type <em>A</em>).

    <p>In particular, we prove that <em>2n</em>- and <em>(2mn+1)</em>-core partitions correspond naturally to dominant alcoves in the <em>m</em>-Shi arrangement of type <em>C<sub>n</sub></em>, generalizing a result of Fishel&ndash;Vazirani for type <em>A</em>.

    <p>We present related conjectures and open questions on the average size of a simultaneous core partition, <em>q</em>-analogs of generalized Catalan numbers, and generalizations to other Coxeter groups.

A new methodology is introduced which utilizes the linear relationship that we have discovered between nanotube cohesive energies determined via Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and weighted-average Madelung Constants (MC(wa)). Slopes and         intercepts of the plots are used to provide ionic charges and relative ionic versus covalent contributions to the bonding. A comparison between ionic and covalent energies shows that as the nanotubes lengthen, ionic bonding furnishes the principal contribution to increasing stabilization. A comparison between the total cohesive and electrostatic energies reveals the percentage ionicity of each nanotube. We also present a new linear relationship between the average ionic coordination number and the weighted-average Madelung Constant.</blockquote>

            nanotubes correlate in an essentially perfectly linear way with cohesive energies determined by DFT. We discuss this correlation in terms of the relationship between lattice energies and
            cohesive energies. Through this linear correlation, Madelung constants are used to predict
            cohesive energies and average ion charges of nanostructures containing up to 3940 ions.
            Cohesive energies of MgO nanotubes are shown to converge to a value lower than those of bulk
            MgO. Using the slopes of the DFT versus Madelung constant plots the average charges on the

The result of this operation is the sum over cycle systems of <em>-1</em> to the power of the number of disjoint cycles times the weight of the cycle system.  The author uses this fact to reprove that the determinant of a matrix of much smaller order can be computed to calculate the number of cycle systems in a hamburger graph.

            with entries in a field <em>F</em> not of characteristic 2.  When <em>K<sup>2</sup>=I</em>, Tao and Yasuda
            defined <em>A</em> to be generalized centrosymmetric with respect to <em>K</em>.  When <em>K<sup>2</sup>=-I</em>, we
            define <em>A</em> to be pseudo-centrosymmetric with respect to <em>K</em>; we show that the determinant of every
            even-order pseudo-centrosymmetric matrix is the sum of two squares over <em>F</em>, as long as <em>-1</em> is not a
            square in <em>F</em>.  When a pseudo-centrosymmetric matrix <em>A</em> contains only integral entries and is
            pseudo-centrosymmetric with respect to a matrix with rational entries, the determinant of <em>A</em> is the sum of
            two integral squares.  This result, when specialized to when <em>K</em> is the even-order alternating exchange
            matrix, applies to enumerative combinatorics.  Using solely matrix-based methods, we reprove a weak form of
            Jockusch's theorem for enumerating perfect matchings of 2-even symmetric graphs.  As a corollary, we reprove that
            the number of domino tilings of regions known as Aztec diamonds and Aztec pillows is a sum of two integral squares.

                    <blockquote><p>We analyze the 1999 Hurricane Floyd evacuation with a traffic-flow model,explaining the extreme congestion on I-26. Then we look at the new South
            Carolina Hurricane Evacuation Plan, which includes lane reversals. We analyze
            their effect; they would significantly benefit traffic leaving Charleston. With
            lane reversals, the maximum number of vehicles passing any point on I-26 is
            6,000 cars/h.</p>
            <p>
            We develop two plans to evacuate the South Carolina coast: the first by
            geographic location, the second by license-plate parity. We explore the use of temporary shelters; we find that I-26 has sufficient
            capacity for oversized vehicles; and we determine the effects of evacuees from
            Georgia and Florida.</p>
